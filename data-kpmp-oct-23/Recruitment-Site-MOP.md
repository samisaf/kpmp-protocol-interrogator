# 1. Introduction 
## 1.1. KPMP Overview 
The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) is a prospective cohort study, whose goal is to use deep molecular phenotypes of kidney biopsies to develop new disease ontologies and treatments for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).


### 1.1.1. Objectives 
Both AKI and CKD impose a significant global health burden. Yet, no effective therapies currently exist for AKI, and only a few are available for CKD. To address this need, KPMP will obtain kidney biopsy tissue from study participants with AKI or CKD. The network will utilize state-of-the-art methods to perform molecular interrogation of the tissue and to link the molecular data to kidney structure and clinical information in the form of a human kidney atlas. Molecular and imaging data derived from kidney tissue will be integrated with clinico-pathologic and genetic information, as well as other datasets derived from the analyses of fluid biospecimens, including peripheral blood and urine. Using advanced analytics to integrate the data, KPMP will aim to define kidney disease subgroups in molecular terms by identifying critical cells, pathways and targets for novel therapies.


### 1.1.2. Description 
Participants with AKI or CKD will be recruited from recruitment sites during clinical care encounters (e.g. clinic visits for CKD patients, hospitalizations or emergency room visits for AKI patients) and from electronic resources (e.g. existing registries, electronic health records). Written informed consent will be obtained from study participants using a uniform informed consent document approved by the KPMP Single IRB at Washington University in St. Louis. For each participant, kidney tissue will be obtained for molecular phenotyping and clinical diagnosis. The diagnostic interpretation will be returned to the participant’s caregiver to inform clinical care, but no treatment interventions will be prescribed by the KPMP. In addition to kidney biopsy, the study will involve collection of baseline (time of biopsy) and longitudinal biospecimen samples (including urine, plasma, serum, and DNA) and demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. Participants will be followed through scheduled in-person and remote (telephone) study visits, as well as through periodic review of electronic health records (EHR). The KPMP biorepository at the University of Michigan will contain biospecimens collected at the biopsy and follow-up visits for future studies. As new RFAs are funded, the biorepository may also include reference kidney tissue obtained from allograft protocol implant biopsies or tumor-free nephrectomy specimens.


All biological samples, clinical datasets, biopsy slides, digital images and other relevant data will be deposited, harmonized, curated, and stored/tracked at the Central Biorepository at the University of Michigan. The Central Hub will manage and administer tissue distribution from the Recruitment Sites to the Tissue Interrogation Sites, where it will be interrogated using complementary, state-of-the-art platforms with rigorous quality control. Data generated at the Tissue Interrogation Sites will be transferred to the Central Hub, where they will be analyzed and visualized to further the scientific interests of the KPMP, including the building of a Kidney Atlas. Participant safety, satisfaction, participant reported outcomes, and the diagnostic yield of kidney biopsies will be systematically assessed. Curated and validated data will be available to the scientific community via an online portal and public research databases. The KPMP will prioritize dissemination of study results to all relevant stakeholders, including study participants, patients, health care providers, researchers, and the broader scientific community.


## 1.2. KPMP Study Organization 
The organizational structure of the KPMP consortium is summarized in Figure 1. 

The KPMP consortium consists of a cooperative agreement between the NIDDK/NIH, one Central Hub, six Recruitment Sites and five Tissue Interrogation Sites.

### Figure 1: KPMP structure 
### 1.2.1. Central Hub 
The purpose of the Central Hub is to aggregate, analyze and visualize all data and samples, and provide scientific, infrastructure and administrative support for the entire KPMP. The Central Hub will collaborate with the KPMP Recruitment Sites and Tissue Interrogation Sites to obtain and evaluate kidney biopsies from study participants with AKI or CKD, create a kidney tissue atlas, define disease subgroups, and identify cells, pathways and targets for novel therapies. The Central Hub is led by a multi-PI plan to allow for synergistic interactions in different areas of expertise to accomplish common goals.

### 1.2.2. Recruitment Sites 
The Recruitment Sites will recruit adult men and women with either AKI or CKD for longitudinal cohort studies that include a research kidney biopsy. The Recruitment Site will work collaboratively to capture demographic information, conduct longitudinal clinical phenotyping, and collect biological samples in a standardized manner.

### 1.2.3. Tissue Interrogation Sites 
Tissue Interrogation Sites will receive kidney biopsy tissue collected from participants at the Recruitment Sites. They will use this tissue to: 

1) investigate kidney cell and disease heterogeneity in tissue sections and/or dissociated cells, 
2) generate high-quality data and images for a kidney tissue atlas, 
3) facilitate the structural, histologic and molecular assessment of cellular “states” associated with healthy function, activation, injury, recovery, and adaptive and maladaptive repair, 
4) develop novel methods to distinguish diseased from non-diseased areas of kidney, and 
5) identify robust structural, histologic and molecular signatures and pathways that can be used to accurately phenotype individuals with AKI or CKD to inform future diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic selection schemes (subgroups).

### 1.2.5. Funding Funding for KPMP is provided by the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney diseases (NIDDK), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services.


### 1.2.6. Project Cycle 
The KPMP study is funded for 5 years at the Central Hub sites University of Washington, University of Michigan and Mount Sinai School of Medicine (September 2017 – June 2022). The KPMP study is funded for 2 years at all Recruitment Sites & Tissue Interrogation Sites (September 2017 – June 2019) with a subsequent three-year competitive renewal period (June 2019 – June 2022). The first year of KPMP focused on consensus building, organizing working groups & committees, protocol development, forms development, development of agreements & contracts and staff training. The recruitment phase begins in the third year of the study and continues through year five.


## 1.3. General Policy 
### 1.3.1. General Protocol Policy 
The first two years of the KPMP (2017-2019) were devoted to establishing feasibility protocols for enrollment, tissue processing and technology development, identifying and implementing quality control procedures, and demonstrating feasibility and safety of the approach. Throughout the pilot phase, the protocol was reviewed and revised to allow implementation of changes before recruitment accelerated starting in year three. Beyond year three, changes in the protocol will be considered only if they are required to ensure participant safety or will significantly enhance the scientific validity of the study. The objectives of the study are most likely to be achieved if the protocol does not require alteration beyond year three.


### 1.3.2. Initiating a Protocol Change 
The Executive and Steering Committees must review and approve all protocol amendments or revisions.


Proposed Protocol changes should be presented in writing to either the Chair of the Executive Committee or to the Clinical Data Coordinating Center (CDCC). The CDCC and/or Chair of the Executive Committee will present the proposed amendment to the Executive Committee and Steering Committee for review and discussion. Approved amendments must be submitted to the single IRB for approval and once approved, be incorporated into the protocol. IRB approval must occur prior to the implementation of an amendment. Amendments that include minor changes to the protocol may undergo expedited review if these changes fit into expedited approval criteria. All changes to the informed consent form must also be approved by the single IRB at Washington University.


# 2. Participant Recruitment 
## 2.1. Overview of Recruitment 
Recruitment Sites will use similar recruiting strategies, but site-specific approaches will optimize effectiveness and efficiency according to their local health care settings and target study population(s).


Strategies will include both recruiting from clinical care encounters (e.g. clinic, emergency room or hospital visits) and recruiting based on electronic health information (e.g. existing registries and electronic health records - EHR). Local recruiting networks will be utilized whenever possible at both CKD and AKI Recruitment Sites. KPMP study candidates will be first asked by their clinicians to agree to an in-person or phone contact from the research team. According to local site-specific procedures and work practices, other modes of first contact, including direct outreach from the researchers to patients, may be considered for recruitment strategies. Research sites will follow local customs when approaching patients (i.e. some Recruitment Sites may require study staff to ask permission of a patient’s clinician before approaching a potential participant).


An in-depth review and discussion of the KPMP will be conducted in the informed consent process for all participants with CKD or AKI. They will be afforded ample time to review the information and have all their questions fully answered. Written informed consent will be obtained from all KPMP participants before any study activities commence. Details of the informed consent process are described in Section 3.4; common themes include:

- Informed consent process will be conducted by a physician and study coordinator team.
- Potential participants will be given information verbally and in print that clearly describes the kidney biopsy procedure, procedural risks, and utilization of samples in the KPMP. This study information will also be posted on the publicly available KPMP website.


### 2.1.1. Approaching Potential CKD Participants 
Recruitment of CKD patients will focus on the outpatient setting. Prospective participants will be identified in several ways, including registries, referrals, direct to patient outreach, or using EHR-based tools to screen for eligibility. Where possible, local CKD registries will be searched using the study entry criteria to find potential participants.

- KPMP study candidates will be first contacted by their clinicians, or other clinic staff.

- Clinician outreach to patients may include in-person discussion, telephone calls, letters, or clinic-approved forms of electronic communication.

- According to local site-specific procedures, other modes of outreach from the researchers to patients may also be used for recruitment.

- If potentially eligible study participants are interested in learning more about the KPMP, they may contact a Research Coordinator, or a Research Coordinator may contact them.

- Prospective participants will also meet in-person with a Research Coordinator and/or study investigator to review and discuss the study in detail.


### 2.1.2. Approaching Potential AKI Participants 
Recruitment of AKI participants will be primarily in the inpatient setting. Some sites will utilize local EHR data to identify potential participants for enrollment. Sites will also screen for potentially eligible participants across nephology consultative services, emergency rooms, and intensive care units.

- Those who are eligible will be discussed with the nephrology attending physician or other care team members to determine if the patient is an appropriate candidate for KPMP.

- The primary clinician will first discuss the KPMP study with the potential participant or their LAR (for open biopsies at the Pittsburgh Recruitment Site).

- If potentially eligible study participants are interested in learning more, they will be informed that a Research Coordinator and/or study investigator will meet with them to discuss study participation.


Recruitment of AKI participants for open kidney biopsy will include patients with established AKI as well as patients at high risk for AKI or in the earliest stages of AKI who undergo laparotomies for indications such as abscess, bowel perforation or infarction, or trauma. These potential participants will be identified through EHR alerts as well as by direct identification by hospital intensivists and surgeons. This population may be enrolled and consented by a LAR.

- The surgeon performing the laparotomy and kidney biopsy, accompanied by a KPMP Research Coordinator and/or study investigator, will discuss study procedures and risks with the participant.

- Potential participants and their LAR will be given information verbally and in print that clearly describes the kidney biopsy procedure, procedural risks, and utilization of samples in the KPMP.

- This study information will also be posted on the publicly available KPMP website.


## 2.2. Study Eligibility Criteria 
Determining eligibility is a multiple step process involving the review of health records, interview of potential participants, and discussion with the potential participant’s healthcare provider and the KPMP study PI. Information collected in the Screening Worksheet, prior to or at the Enrollment Visit represents the first step in determining a participant’s eligibility based on available information. A screening consent process is available when needed to obtain biosamples to verify eligibility. Recruitment Sites should consider the location of the participant to determine if they live close enough to the clinic to return for in-person follow-up visits.


Note on Incident COVID-19 Infected Individuals:
Patients presenting with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases of COVID-19 may be enrolled in the KPMP protocol and be biopsied. KPMP no-fault harm insurance does extend to these individuals. The Pre-Biopsy Safety CRF asks whether the participant tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 21 days.


If Yes, this status will be tagged in the metadata associated with the biosamples obtained from the participant. Presence or absence of COVID-19 infection is not an eligibility criterion for KPMP.


### 2.2.1. CKD Participant Inclusion Criteria

- The timing between qualifying eGRF/urine albumin/urine protein and date of biopsy is up to the discretion of the PI, but blood safety labs must be completed within 2 weeks of the biopsy.

- Albuminuria is the same as urine albumin excretion; proteinuria is the same as urine protein excretion.


### 2.2.2. AKI Participant Inclusion Criteria AKI Percutaneous Biopsy Inclusion Criteria Patients are eligible for the KPMP Study if they meet all three of the following AKI-specific criteria.
Bolded terms are defined below. Note that PI judgement determines whether to enroll and perform a biopsy for participants that meet eligibility criteria and then appear to be recovering.


1. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 45 mL/min/1.73m2 . Baseline serum creatinine is defined by the median of the last three outpatient serum creatinine from days 7 to 

365 prior to enrollment. If the AKI RS PI believes that the Baseline serum creatinine under or over-estimates baseline, a unanimous vote of AKI site PIs can confirm eligibility based on a consensus serum creatinine (See section 5.2.2 for more details).

  - If only two measurements obtained within this window, the two eGFR results will be averaged.

  - If only one measurement was obtained within this window, this eGFR result will be used 
  - If baseline is missing the patient can be enrolled with an estimated Baseline serum creatinine, but only if there is no past medical history of chronic kidney disease. If the patient’s Age and Sex are entered in the New Participant CRF, the Eligibility Assessment CRF will calculate the estimated GFR based on the expected serum creatinine. See Table 1 for reference.


### Table 1. Estimated Baseline serum creatinine1
To be used only when no past medical history of CKD and no clinical signs of advanced CKD (serum phosphate < 5 mg/dl and plasma PTH < 70 pg/ml).[22]
Age (years) Male sCr (mg/dl) Female sCr (mg/dl) 

20–24 1.4 1.1 

25–29 1.3 1.0 

30–39 1.2 1.0 

40–54 1.2 0.9 

55–65 1.1 0.9 >65 1.1 0.8 

1 Baseline creatinine was estimated using the highest age in each category for a target eGFR of 75 with the 2021 CKD-EPI equation. For the final category, creatinine was estimated using an age of 66.


2. Elevated/Index serum creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.5 times Baseline sCr as defined above).


3. And at least ONE of the following:

  - A repeat serum creatinine within no less than 6 and no more than 48 hours of initial serum creatinine that is still greater than or equal to 1.5 times the Baseline as defined above. Once patient qualifies, they can still be enrolled if creatinine goes down. PI judgement determines whether to perform biopsy if patient is getting better.
Elevated/Index creatinine does not have to be the admission value.

  - Positive kidney injury urine biomarker, as defined by any of the following:
 NGAL level greater than or equal to 150 ng/mL by ELISA or clinical analyzer  KIM1 level greater than or equal to 2.8 ng/mL by ELISA  TIMP2 x IGFBP7 greater than or equal to 2.0 by NephroCheck®

 greater than or equal to 1 Renal Tubular Epithelial cells (RTE) per high powered field (HPF) AND greater than or equal to 1 granular cast/ low powered field (LPF); or  greater than or equal to 5 Renal Tubular Epithelial cells (RTE) per high powered field (HPF); or  greater than or equal to 5 granular cast/ low powered field (LPF) Creatinine Term Definitions:

- "Baseline sCr" = the value from days 7 to 365 prior to enrollment. Value is calculated based on 

1-3 available sCr measurements or imputed based on age/race/gender 
- "Admission sCr" = the value at time of admission 
- "Elevated/Index sCr" = the value greater than or equal to 1.5 times Baseline sCr (also called "initial sCr") 
- "Repeat sCr" = the value within 48 hours of Elevated/Index sCr, which should show further increase of at least 0.3 mg/dl 

### 2.2.3. Special Populations 
#### 2.2.3.1. AKI Open Biopsy Inclusion Criteria (Bolded terms defined above in the AKI Percutaneous biopsy inclusion criteria) 
Patients undergoing open laparotomy/surgical biopsy are eligible for KPMP if they have AKI clinical indication with:


1. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 45 mL/min/1.73m2 as defined above in Table 1 AND one of the following:


2. Elevated/Index serum creatinine (greater than 1.5 times Baseline sCr) or increase in serum creatinine greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, above Admission serum creatinine. Once patient qualifies, they can still be enrolled if creatinine goes down. PI judgement determines whether to perform biopsy if patient is getting better.

Determined at time of Eligibility Assessment prior to consent. Factors that change post-consent but pre-biopsy will result in the patient being withdrawn due to loss of eligibility:

- Non-English or Spanish language 
- Less than 18 years of age 
- Severe allergy to iodinated contrast 
- Pregnancy 
- Transplant recipient (kidney or non-kidney, including solid organ and bone marrow transplantation) 
- Additional vulnerable individuals (incarcerated, institutionalized, or otherwise unable to participate in the study)

- Unwilling to receive blood transfusion (if needed) Determined by kidney ultrasound before the biopsy procedure (may be the same day as the biopsy procedure). Factors that are detected pre-biopsy will result in the patient being withdrawn due to loss of eligibility:

- Kidney depth more than 13 cm (as measured perpendicular from the skin) (percutaneous biopsies only) 
- Kidney size less than 8 cm (percutaneous biopsies only) 
- Solitary or single functioning kidney 
- Evidence of urinary tract obstruction or hydronephrosis 
- Multiple bilateral kidney cysts that will interfere with the safe performance of the biopsy 
- Any other imaging abnormality, which in the judgement of the operator, prevents biopsy being performed safely.
Determined by the most recent blood test within 2 weeks of CKD biopsy or 48 hours for AKI biopsy.
Factors that are detected pre-biopsy will result in the patient being withdrawn due to loss of eligibility:

- International Normalized Ratios (INR) greater than 1.4 
- Platelet count less than 100,000/uL 
- Hemoglobin less than 9 g/dL 

# 3. Participant Enrollment 
## 3.1. Population and Recruitment 
The diversity within the CKD and AKI Recruitment Sites will facilitate recruitment and enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities who are over-represented among patients with kidney diseases such as people of African ancestry, Hispanic ethnicity, or American Indians and Alaskan Natives. In addition, representation of women will correspond to the fraction of women in the population diagnosed with CKD and AKI. Participants will be drawn from a variety of primary kidney care and specialty care clinics in academic and community practices (e.g. nephrology, diabetes and general endocrinology, internal medicine, family medicine, cardiology, intensive care, surgery). Engagement of patients and clinicians by regular outreach and ongoing dissemination of study progress and results will enhance recruitment.

- The KPMP will track enrollment according to stage and clinical diagnosis of CKD or AKI in order to assure appropriate representation from target populations.

- Reasons for non-participation will be ascertained to mitigate selection bias and to optimize site recruiting practices.

- Race/ethnicity and sex/gender will be tracked to assure that KPMP achieves population-level demographics reflective of patients affected by the targeted causes of CKD or AKI.

- The KPMP will strive to enroll participants residing across a broad geography, inclusive of both rural and urban regions.

- KPMP will not exclude participants who are enrolled in other research studies.

- Participants who enroll in KPMP and have a biopsy that does not provide sufficient tissue for diagnostic or research analyses will be encouraged to participate in follow-up calls and visits for the full timeframe of the study (expected up to 10 years).


## 3.2. Eligibility assessment 
A multi-pronged assessment of eligibility is required to maximize participant safety. First, a Research Coordinator(s) will assess each quantifiable eligibility criterion using a KPMP Screening Worksheet (see Appendix F). Second, a physician(s) will assess more detailed aspects of eligibility (e.g. risks of bleeding from kidney biopsy beyond standard KPMP eligibility criteria). The physician(s) will also quantify anticipated potential benefits and risks for the individual patient considering participation in order to facilitate informed consent and scientifically evaluate the value of KPMP kidney biopsies. See section 2.2 for eligibility criteria.


After eligibility criteria are initially confirmed and consent is signed, study activities may proceed, including participant-completed questionnaires, physical measurements, and/or any biospecimen collection. Eligibility assessment continues throughout these baseline study activities. If the individual is withdrawn or loses eligibility at any point prior to the completion of the biopsy, they are not considered fully enrolled and will not be followed longitudinally. For a participant to be considered fully enrolled in KPMP, the biopsy must be performed. See sections 5.2 and 5.3 for details on these ongoing eligibility assessment processes and section 3.5 for details on what eligibility assessment failures constitute a protocol deviation.


## 3.3. Approaching Potential Participants 
- A study team physician will meet with each potential participant or their LAR, if applicable, to discuss the KPMP study and conduct the informed consent process during a clinic or hospital visit. Complete review of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be performed.

- The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the research study will be discussed in detail.

- Potential participants or their LAR will be afforded ample time to review the information and have all their questions fully answered at a single session or extended over several interactions with the study team.

- Site investigators will be available to answer any questions or provide additional information to those considering KPMP participation. The biopsy operator will be available to explain the biopsy procedure and safety risks.

- Written and video recruitment materials will be provided in either English or Spanish. Spanish-speaking participants who are enrolled must sign a Spanish-translated IRB-approved informed consent form.


## 3.4. Informed Consent 
Reliance agreements will be established between the Washington University (St. Louis) Institutional Review Board (IRB), the single IRB for the KPMP, and the IRBs at the CKD and AKI Recruitment Sites. The Washington University IRB will review and approve the KPMP Informed Consent Form along with all participant-facing materials, the clinical protocol and any amendments or study changes. The KPMP study will comply with the Declaration of Helsinki. The most current consent form should always be used; recruitment site personnel should download the site consent directly from myIRB.


The consent process can occur either in-person or via phone or video chat. The signed consent form must be received (via secure email, fax, regular mail, or any HIPAA-compliant procedure) by the RS before any study procedures, including questionnaires, can begin.


### 3.4.1. Obtaining Informed 
Consent from the Participant The informed consent process is the cornerstone of ensuring safe and ethical implementation of the KPMP. Informed consent is the primary process through which KPMP procedures, risks, and benefits will be fully disclosed to potential participants and through which potential participants will choose whether to take part in the KPMP. This process will involve multiple exchanges of information between potential participants, study staff, clinicians, and other trusted advisors (such as individuals within their family, friend group, faith or other shared community, or patient advocate group), in the participant’s language of choice (either English or Spanish). Informed consent and screening will proceed in parallel, so that information obtained through screening can be used to inform potential participants of their individual expected risks and benefits. The informed consent process may be completed during a single encounter, but more frequently will involve serial interactions over a period of time.


Throughout the process, potential participants will be encouraged to ask questions of study staff, clinicians, and trusted advisors. Contributors to the informed consent process and their roles include:


1. The participant. The potential participant is the focus of the informed consent process. Most potential participants will choose to include trusted advisors in their decision-making.


2. Research coordinator. A trained Research Coordinator(s) will be primarily responsible for providing a complete overview of the KPMP protocol. This overview will include all elements of the protocol relevant to the individual participant (e.g. CKD or AKI group), including but not limited to a general description of the kidney biopsy, the general risks and benefits associated with kidney biopsy, data and biosample collection, collection and use of genetic information, plans for long-term follow-up, and overall study risks and benefits. As part of this process, the Research Coordinator will review the entire written informed consent form with the potential participant.


3. Physician. A physician(s) with adequate knowledge of the potential participant’s clinical status will evaluate the risks and benefits of a kidney biopsy and KPMP participation for each individual potential participant. This physician may be a clinician with adequate knowledge of the KPMP protocol or a KPMP physician who has adequate knowledge of the participant’s clinical condition, or multiple physicians may confer to provide comprehensive evaluation and information to the potential participant. The physician(s) will assess the individual’s potential risks (particularly those related to kidney biopsy) and benefits (particularly potential knowledge derived from the clinical pathology report). This report will include the clinical diagnosis for CKD or AKI, prognostic information regarding the expected future course of CKD or AKI, and/or clinical management. Risks and benefits will be thoroughly discussed with the potential participant, offering an opportunity for questions and discussion. If the physician feels that a kidney biopsy is unacceptably risky, the potential participant will not be offered enrollment in the KPMP.


4. Participant advocates. In some cases, KPMP sites may offer potential participants access to patients who know the KPMP protocol and have had an opportunity to reflect on the protocol from a patient perspective. Patient-to-patient contact may help potential participants understand how participating in the KPMP may affect their health and health care.
IRB-approved, written informed consent will be required of all KPMP study participants. Spanish-speaking participants must review and sign an IRB-approved Spanish-translated consent form. Only those who express interest in participation, meet all eligibility criteria, and provide written informed consent will be enrolled. They will sign and date the consent form indicating their understanding and willingness to participate. Study activities will commence only after written informed consent is obtained. Documentation of consent process activities and participant’s understanding is recorded in the Consent Form in the REDCap Participant Management Program.


### 3.4.2. Obtaining Informed 
Consent from a LAR KPMP allows LAR consent at the Pittsburgh Recruitment Site in the setting of AKI surgical/open biopsies.


When and where coordinators will approach the legally authorized representative LARs can be contacted at bedside, in patient waiting areas, private area or via telephone. Consent conversation can take place with a LAR anywhere that they are comfortable. However, patient’s LAR must be present to sign consent. Consent criteria for a LAR is the same as if they are a patient. Consent must be reviewed in its entirety. The Physician-Investigator must be the individual to complete the informed consent with the LAR (noting that the physician-investigator who works with the LAR to complete the consent will not be the same person who performs the surgery).


Talking points for introducing the study Introduction process is the same for LAR as it is for a Patient. The study team must first be introduced by a clinical staff member who can confirm that the LAR is willing to speak/hear about research. After LAR is willing to speak to research, it is best to start with the Who, What, When, Where, and Why of the study as an introduction (Essentially everything covered on first 1-3 pages of Consent); who we are, what we are researching, why we are approaching LAR on behalf of the patient, where the research will be done, and when and for how long the research will occur. If LAR is still interested, the Physician-Investigator will join the conversation to answer any questions and review full consent (noting that the physician- investigator who works with the LAR to complete the consent process will not be the same person who performs the surgery). The physician investigator will review the informed consent form section by section making sure LAR understands each section and encourage LAR to ask questions. The LAR will sign consent as they would if they were the patient. Remind the LAR that the patient will be asked to sign the consent after they regain the ability to do so.


A general outline of how coordinators will explain the study The script is the consent itself (a summary of the study). For LAR consent, the informed consent form will be reviewed section by section in its entirety because it goes through everything the LAR needs to know from why they are being approached to what is being asked of them on behalf of the patient; and then other aspects of how the study will affect the patient (e.g., potential payments, risks, benefits, contact information for the study, ability to withdraw and how to do so, etc.). The informed consent form is written in a format that is easy to understand. The study team is required to go section by section reviewing the entire consent. Ask questions to ensure the LAR understands what was discussed and ask them to return the information (to confirm they understand); Encourage the LAR to ask any and as many questions as they have about the study and process.
Explain that when a patient (who had LAR consent signed for them) regains capacity to consent on their own, a study coordinator or investigator will re-approach the patient, explain the study and what has been done up until that point, and determine if the patient wants to continue to be in the study (note once again that the physician-investigator who works with the patient to complete the consent will not be the same person who does the surgery). If the patient should decide to decline, we cannot undo a biopsy or return labs that have already been collected, thus in most situations we will maintain the samples that have already been collected to use for the study but will not have any more follow up with patient, aside from potential safety monitoring post biopsy for 28-days.


Assigning a LAR and describing their role A Legally Authorized Representative is legally allowed to consent for a patient when the patient temporarily or permanently lacks the capacity to consent on their own.


For the Pittsburgh site, only family members are allowed to sign consent as a LAR, unless there is power of attorney or guardianship. Pennsylvania state law provides hierarchy on who the appropriate LAR would be if multiple family members are present.


If the patient is incapable of consenting for themselves, then approach an authorized representative regarding enrollment. The authorized representative is often the next of kin unless the patient has a pre-existing legal document specifying another individual is responsible for medical decision making for them. The preferred order for legal authorized representative is as follows:


1. spouse, unless an action for divorce is pending, and the adult children of the principal are not the children of the spouse 

2. adult child 

3. a parent (natural or adoptive) 

4. adult brother or sister 

5. adult grandchild 

6. an adult who has knowledge of the principal’s preferences and values, including, but not limited to, religious and moral beliefs, to assess how the principal would make health care decisions The LAR will be given ample time to review the consent document prior to speaking with the physician-investigator. The study will be described in lay terminology, explaining the risks and emphasizing that the decision to participate (or not) in the investigation will have no effect on routine medical care. The listed Physician-Investigator obtaining consent will provide their name and phone number and suggest that the LAR call if they have further questions or wish to withdraw from the study at any time. The listed investigator obtaining the consent will also provide the participant or their representative with a written copy of the consent form and ample time to have questions answered prior to enrollment.


(Again, note that the physician- investigator who completes the consent process will not be the same person who performs the surgery.) Additional information added for LAR consent explains that participants who are enrolled when cognitively impaired will be given the opportunity to consent to further participation (or to withdraw) once they regain decision-making capacity. Both participants and their LAR can choose to withdraw the participant from the study at any time. Explanation will be given regarding what will happen to samples should LAR give consent and then withdraw consent; or the patient declines consent when they regain ability to give self-consent.
When and where the re-consent will take place Re-consent will most likely occur at the bedside. Obtain consent from the patient as soon as possible after the patient has regained capacity.


### 3.4.3. Participant Confidentiality 
KPMP records will not be shared with those not involved in participants’ clinical care or not involved in the KPMP, except as required by law. Records relating to this study will be kept strictly confidential, and all personal health information (PHI) will be protected according to the HIPAA Privacy Rule. PHI will be stored in a password-protected, encrypted database. Only KPMP personnel will have access to this database. Any paper records will be stored in a locked cabinet in a secure room. Publication of study results will not identify individual study participants.


KPMP data are covered under a Certificate of Confidentiality agreement from the NIH (Section 2012 of 21st Century Cures Act as implemented in 2017 NIH Certificates of Confidentiality Policy). A Certificate of Confidentiality allows researchers to refuse to disclose identifiable research information in response to legal demands. Certificates are issued to researchers to help protect the privacy of human participants enrolled in sensitive, health-related research. A description of the KPMP will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov. This website will not include information that can identify study participants or PHI but may include a general summary of the data.


The following groups will have access to participant records from the KPMP study:
- Research staff at the Recruitment Sites 
- National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases staff and their representatives 
- Washington University IRB 
- KPMP Clinical Data Coordinating Center at the University of Washington Kidney tissue from KPMP will be banked and studied by detailed genetic and other omics interrogations.


Genetic information, particularly on a scale likely to be generated from genome-wide SNP arrays or whole exome and/or genomic sequencing, is individually identifying and the risks of re-identification of research participants from unauthorized access to their genomic information is a privacy risk [3]. To protect participants from such risks, genetic information will be released only to qualified researchers for selected KPMP-approved ancillary studies. The researchers will sign a data use agreement that includes a stipulation that prohibits attempts to re-identify study participants.


Federal and State laws, including the Genetic Information and Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), make it illegal for health insurance companies, health plans, and employers to discriminate against individuals based on genetic information, which affords some measure of protection for participants in the event of an unintended disclosure of genetic data.


## 3.5. Protocol Deviations 
Two classes of departures from KPMP procedure or protocol are designated for identification, tracking, and reporting. These include Major and Minor protocol Deviations as defined below.


### 3.5.1. Minor Deviations 
Minor Deviations are defined as departures from a study protocol or KPMP methods or procedure that do not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others, and do not adversely affect the integrity or validity of the major scientific goals of the study.
Minor deviations include (but are not limited to):

- failure to obtain appropriate source documentation 
- failure to achieve appropriate KPMP certification prior to performing procedures*
- mistimed procedures (performing a lab test or visit outside the window outlined in the protocol when, in the opinion of the investigator, there are no safety implications) 
- using an outdated version of a data collection form**
- missed follow-up visits due to Recruitment Site negligence 
- use of an expired consent form in which the information contained is not substantively different than the currently approved consent, unless the deviation occurs repeatedly 
- a signed copy of the consent form was not given to the participant 
- a missing investigator signature on the consent form 
- Collecting participant-provided questionnaires and/or baseline biospecimen (e.g. blood/urine/stool (NOT renal tissue)) from a participant who does not meet eligibility criteria for a factor that should have been known prior to the execution of the study activity(ies); see Figure 2 below.


*If certification-related deviations persist at a given center and an uncertified individual continues to carry out study procedures without proper KPMP training, serious effects on data quality may result.


Such a scenario leads to the possibility of major deviations being assigned.


**Likewise, if an outdated version of a form used by a center in error references incorrect study eligibility criteria, major deviations may be assigned. These situations will be reviewed and classified on a case-by-case basis by the Safety & Adjudication Subcommittee (SAC), in consultation with the CDCC and the Clinical Operations Committee.


If a given center experiences a high frequency of minor protocol deviations in a specific area, the CDCC will address this issue with the PIs of the center and the NIDDK in an effort to resolve the problem.


Minor deviations (or events that may qualify as minor deviations) should be submitted to the CDCC using the REDCap project called KPMP Issue Tracker within 3 business days of their identification. The SAC will review the event within one week of submission and determine whether any follow-up is advisable (such as re-training, change of supplies, revision to a MOP, notification to stakeholders, etc.).


Minor protocol deviations will be summarized and provided to the IRB at the time of the continuing review. Minor protocol deviations will be summarized and provided to the DSMB during biannual reviews (note: as of June 2022, the DSMB would like to receive notice of minor deviations pertaining to ineligibility within 3 business days of receipt by the CDCC. This will be re-evaluated after a period of review). Minor deviations from other KPMP methods or procedures (i.e. those that deviate from an MOP or other study material but not from the protocol) will not systematically be reported to the IRB but will be reported via REDCap Issue Tracker and reviewed by the SAC or other appropriate adjudicator to enable trend tracking and nimble intervention where needed.


### 3.5.2. Major Deviations 
A Major Deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others, to adversely affect data quality, to significantly affect the integrity of the major scientific goals of the study, and/or to involve a significant and repeated breach of subjects’ privacy.
Major deviations include (but are not limited to):

- failure to obtain legally effective informed consent appropriately and prior to initiating research procedures 
- informed consent obtained by someone other than individuals authorized by the IRB to obtain informed consent 
- enrollment (i.e. biopsy) of ineligible subjects (i.e. those who do not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria; see Figure 2 below) 
- performing a study procedure that has not been approved by the IRB 
- failing to conduct a study procedure or administer a study assessment that was meant to assess the safety of the individual’s continuation in the study mistimed procedures (performing a lab test or visit outside the window outlined in the protocol that, in the opinion of the investigator, may impact the safety of the participant) 
- failure to carry out study procedures in the appropriate order, when applicable 
- misplacement/loss of biological specimens 
- misplacement/loss of study documentation or data/ data collection forms 
- Inappropriate release of PHI 
- Implementation of recruitment procedures that have not been IRB-approved 
- Failure to report an Unanticipated Problem to the IRB Figure 2 illustrates the dynamic eligibility assessment processes from initial engagement through biopsy.


It indicates how eligibility failures are categorized as either screen failures, withdrawals, minor deviations, or major deviations.
By the nature of their definition, major deviations are considered the most serious class of departure from the study protocol. All major deviations will be reported to the Recruitment Site PI, Safety & Adjudication Subcommittee, CDCC, the sIRB, NIDDK, DSMB, and the Clinical Operations Committee.


Major deviations must be reported to the IRB within 10 business days of the occurrence of the event or notification to the PI of the event. The only exception to the timeframe is major deviations resulting in death of a participant, which must be reported within 1 day.


Major deviations (or events that may qualify as major deviations) should also be submitted to the CDCC using the REDCap project called “KPMP Issue Tracker” within 3 business days of their identification. The DCC will notify the DSMB within 3 business days of receipt of the REDCap submission. The SAC will review the event within one week of submission and determine whether any follow-up is advisable (such as re-training, change of supplies, revision to a MOP, notification to stakeholders, etc.). The SAC will also ensure reporting to the IRB, if that step has not yet been completed.


# 4. Retention 
Retention of participants is central to the internal validity of the study and will be an extraordinarily high priority of the investigators and staff. Recruitment Site investigators will consider the expectation of ten years of follow-up when identifying potential participants and throughout the informed consent process, assessing willingness to commit to a long-term follow-up period.


## 4.1. Strategies to Maximize Retention 
A key element to maximize retention is a pleasant, attentive and responsive staff that provides a reasonably flexible visit schedule. Other clinical center features that promote high retention rates include local tracking systems; frequent staff meetings; free and convenient parking; personal contacts through birthday cards, holiday cards, sympathy cards and flowers; small gifts at visits; and modest monetary incentives. We will stay in frequent contact with study participants, through a combination of in-person and remote follow-up visits, newsletters, and personal contacts. We recognize that study participants who feel valued will have a higher likelihood of maintaining study contact and complying with requested biospecimen collections. We anticipate providing research participants with annual incentives from the KPMP to include reusable totes, water bottles, umbrellas, notepads and the like.


A critical component of maintaining a study participant’s engagement in the study will be creating an environment in which participants feel truly like a partner in KPMP. We are working with our Community Engagement Committee (CEC) to focus on what participants would like to receive in terms of study information or results, and how best to communicate study findings to participants. The CEC will also explore ways to include the participants actively, such as including them in the CEC itself or providing them with contact information for local patient advocacy groups.


Successful strategies from various prospective cohort studies, including the Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae in Acute Kidney Injury (ASSESS-AKI), Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study (CRIC), Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), and Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (CPROBE) will be employed, including:

- Reimbursement for time, travel and parking.

- Phone and address listings for participants and their contacts will be updated at each interaction (visits/phone).

- Study newsletters (providing information on the study progress and results, along with general and kidney-specific health messages) will be mailed.

- Personalized birthday, holiday greetings, and sympathy cards will be sent.

- Approximately two to four weeks prior to the time for the follow-up visits, a phone call will be placed to the participant to schedule the date and time of the appointment.

- A reminder letter with the date, time, and location of the visit may be sent to the participant immediately after the visit is scheduled.

- A reminder phone call may be provided prior to the scheduled visit.

- Participating clinical centers will be encouraged to offer evening and weekend appointments to make it possible for participants with work and other obligations that limit their flexibility to attend study visits during regular business hours (8:00 AM – 5:00 PM Monday-Friday).

- Participants who live far from the Recruitment Site or have other issues making travel too burdensome may complete study visits by phone. In such instances, biological specimens and processing could be coordinated with a local laboratory and shipped directly to the KPMP Biorepository.

- Proxy interviews to collect primary outcomes will be conducted if the participant is deceased or has diminished cognitive functioning.

- Social Security Number information that will be used for ascertaining vital status among participants who are lost to follow-up.
The study team is acutely sensitive to the need for high participant retention and will continually evaluate new retention methods that can be tested and implemented in KPMP.


## 4.2. Follow-up Procedures and Participant Tracking 
Research Coordinators should begin contacting participants 2 months prior to their annual visit and follow-up visits. Contact windows are minus and plus 3 months of the target date, therefore, contacting participants early in the visit window allows the Research Coordinator maximum flexibility in scheduling appointments or time to locate hard-to-reach participants. The REDCap Participant Management Program provides a calendar application to assist in scheduling participants. A suggested template letter for scheduling clinic visits is available on Basecamp.


To maximize retention, study visits will be scheduled to coincide with clinic visits when possible. This will be done by utilizing electronic health record documents, whereby research coordinators will be asked to surveil the medical appointments of consented participants to schedule their follow-up visits in conjunction with when the participant will already be visiting the clinic. Blood specimens will be coordinated as much as possible to concur with any clinical laboratories being drawn, reducing the number of needle pokes a participant undergoes.


Participants who relocate to an area from which it is no longer feasible (or they refuse) to travel to a Recruitment Site will continue to be contacted annually for a remote visit. Efforts should be made to complete as many components of the annual visit as possible when it must be conducted remotely.
Strategies include:

- Recruitment Sites may offer inducements to participants who relocate in the form of additional travel reimbursement in return for their continued participation.

- Recruitment Sites may request a records release to gain access to the participant’s medical record in order to obtain updated measurements and values to complete forms like the Physical Measurements CRF, Follow-up Medical Events CRF, Laboratory Results CRF, Medications CRF, and Post Biopsy Hospitalizations CRF.

- Options for access include linking to EPIC if systems are compatible, asking the participant to print and mail medical records documents, and asking the participant to share medical records via HIPAA-compliant file sharing services like Box. Protecting participant privacy should be a priority when considering these options.


If a participant cannot be reached by their preferred contact method, all contact methods should be tried, during a variety of days or times (weekdays, weekends, mornings, evenings). A maximum of three contact attempts per visit is advised. If the first two attempts are unsuccessful, the third should be a personal letter mailed to the participant (see template here). If a third attempt is unsuccessful after more than two weeks, one attempt should be made to reach the secondary contact.


## 4.3. Missed Annual In-Person Visits 
Visits and allowable windows are outlined in Table 2. Follow-up visits alternate between remote and in-person visits. When one visit window closes, the next immediately opens. It is a priority to obtain the in-person components when possible; therefore, if the RS is unable to schedule an in-person annual follow-up visit before the visit window closes, it is possible (but not mandatory) to continue attempts to complete the visit late. The missed in-person visit can be attempted up until the next in-person visit window opens. It is preferable to collect as much of the in-person follow-up visit data as possible, even if this information is collected in the ‘late’ window, than to miss the opportunity to complete labs and questionnaires.
Clarification of Terms An annual follow-up is considered “late” when it is conducted outside the allowable window dates.


An annual follow-up is considered “missing” if it does not occur before the allowable window closes. The status can be converted to “late” if completed before the next annual, in-person follow-up window opens; otherwise, it is permanently coded as “missing.”


Example Scenario Figure 3 below outlines a decision tree the RS can use to determine visit strategy when an in-person visit window has closed without successful visit completion. Figure 3 outlines the hypothetical scenario in which three contact attempts were made during the 12 month In-Person visit window (which opened at 9 months and closed at 15 months), but the RS was not able to complete the visit. When the RS next successfully connects with the participant, the next visit window (for the 18-month Remote visit) is open.
The RS should determine at this time whether the participant is willing and able to come in and complete the In-Person visit:

- If they are, the recruitment site has the flexibility to complete the 12-month visit. It will be categorized as “Late.”

- If they are not willing/able to come in for the in-person visit components, the RS will instead complete the scheduled 18-month Remote visit. The 12-month In-Person visit will be categorized as permanently “Missing” and the RS will next contact the participant in association with the 24-month In-Person visit.


Figure 3. Example decision tree for missed in-person visits.
If, after the 12-month in person visit is procured “Late,” there is time remaining in the 18-month remote visit window, the RS has flexibility to attempt to also complete the 18-month Remote visit before the window closes. This constitutes the completion of two follow-up visits within one follow-up visit window, so the RS should exercise judgement and determine the best approach on a case-by-case basis.


Follow-up visit windows are six months long, so there may be adequate time to reasonably complete two visits in one window without over-burdening the participant.
It is recommended that the site communicate with the participant at the conclusion of the Late In-Person visit: “Your next follow-up visit is a remote visit, and we’d like to complete it by [insert visit window date]. Would it be OK with you if we call you around then to do that together?” If the remote visit cannot be completed before the visit window closes, the remote visit will be coded “Missing”.


Again, it is more important to prioritize obtaining a “Late” In-Person visit and risk a “Missing” Remote visit than to accept a “Missing” In-Person visit and an “On Time” Remote visit.
Example: the 24-month visit window is open from months 21-27. The coordinator called to schedule the In-Person visit, but discovered the participant has moved and is not able to travel to the clinic during the visit window. However, the participant is planning to be in town during month 30 and would be willing to complete the visit then. Month 30 is within the next, remote visit window, which has the target range of 27-33 months. What should the coordinator do?

- The site should prioritize completion of the in-person visit components and work with the participant to complete the 24-month visit when the participant is available in Month 30. The coordinator will enter all data in the 24-month visit section of REDCap, which will be categorized as completed “Late.”

- The remote Month 30 visit window closes at 33 months. If possible, the coordinator should aim to complete this visit near the end of the visit window, so that the participant is not providing similar data updates too close together, as many elements of the visit are repeated at both in-person and remote visits. If the participant is not able or willing to complete the remote Month 30 visit, it is “Missed”.

- If the 24-month visit cannot be scheduled until month 33, then the 24-month in-person visit is “missed” because the 36 month in-person visit window is now open.
An Issue Tracker record should be submitted to acknowledge the Late visit and provide explanation.
Missed Remote Visits This scenario does not extend to Missed Remote visits. If a remote visit window closes without successful visit completion, the Remote visit is permanently coded as “missed”. When the RS next attempts to connect with the participant, the next in-person visit window is open. In-person visit components should be prioritized. The RS should begin scheduling attempts early in the visit window to maximize the likelihood of successful completion. If, toward the end of the visit window, it becomes apparent the participant will not or cannot come in for in-person components, the RS can seek to complete just the components associated with the ‘in-person visit’ that can be completed remotely.


## 4.4. Participants Lost to Follow-up 
For KPMP, loss to follow-up is defined similarly to ASSESS-AKI: two consecutive years with no visit, no phone call contact, and no outcome data.
Every effort should be made to encourage participants to continue with study visits. Strategies that KPMP will use to limit loss to follow-up include:

- Collection of contact information is vital and will be updated as needed at each contact point. In addition to collecting address, email and phone numbers for the participant, information for an emergency contact, and up to three physicians will be collected. Participants will be encouraged to contact their local recruitment site to report changes to contact information that might occur between visits.

- Social media, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, are useful tools for finding participants who have relocated.

- Phone-calls can be used in lieu of an in-person visit if the participant has moved away but is otherwise willing to continue participation.

- Electronic health records can be used to update contact information.
Participants may remain in the study and contribute only EHR data if they do not participate in follow-up calls and visits. In the current era, a variety of passive surveillance methods can be implemented, allowing for data collection on participants even if they miss clinic visits. These include:

- Collection of data from electronic health records, including vital status, end stage kidney disease status, laboratory data, and hospitalization data.

- Ascertainment of end stage kidney disease from the USRDS 

- Ascertainment of vital status from the National Death Index The only exception to this would be a participant who withdraws consent, in which case there will be no ongoing new data collection from any source (see section 4.5).


## 4.5. Participant Withdrawal 
It is anticipated that over the course of time, a small number of KPMP participants may stop participating in the study post-consent.
There are many reasons why a participant may choose to stop participating, including:

- Unanticipated events unrelated to the study 
- Significant concurrent illness 
- Relocation and unwilling to participate in home visits 
- Dissatisfaction with study 
- Loss of interest in the study There are also scenarios in which a PI may choose to remove a participant, including:
- Loss of eligibility 
- Loss of contact 
- Progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) – see handling details below In the case of either participant-driven or investigator-driven removal, it is important to have a clear conversation with the participant and address their questions and/or considerations.


Clarification of terms Withdrawal: The informed consent states that the participant can change their mind about being in KPMP at any time and asks them to please notify the Recruitment Site if they decide they want to withdraw (quit) by calling or writing an email or letter. The consent also states “if you withdraw, your record will not be used for new studies. We will stop contacting you. However, if researchers already have your KPMP record, we will not be able to get it back. Also, we will let researchers check the results of past studies. If they need your KPMP record to do this work, we will give it to them. Even if you withdraw, we will keep your name and contact information.”
In practical application, a ‘withdrawal’ should be ascertained by the Recruitment Site as either a cessation or a retraction.

- A cessation means that the participant no longer wishes to continue conducting KPMP activities in the future, but is OK allowing their existing KPMP record to be used for new studies. A cessation may constitute no further contact with the participant, or the participant may express interest in continuing to receive KPMP study updates, but without their further personal involvement in research activities at this time.

- A retraction is a complete withdrawal as described in the consent form. A retraction indicates that the participant no longer wishes to continue conducting KPMP activities, and wants their existing KPMP record to be stricken, to the extent reasonable. It is anticipated that retraction withdrawals should be rare events. If a participant expresses a wish for retraction, the Recruitment Site should contact the Central Hub. KPMP is open data science, so it may not be possible to retract all participant data from public domains. The consent acknowledges that once researchers have the record, we cannot get it back. It may be possible to destroy unused biosamples, if the participant wishes. The Central Hub and Recruitment Site will collaborate to determine the best course of action to honor the participant’s wishes.


Participant-Driven Withdrawal If a participant requests to stop participating in KPMP, the Recruitment Site team will solicit the participant’s reason(s). If the reason(s) may potentially be remediated, the site may explore ways to accommodate the participant to allow their continued participation, taking care not to be coercive or to minimize the participant’s concern(s).


If remediation is not possible, reason(s) for quitting will be documented in the End of Study CRF in the Participant Management Program (PMP). It is assumed that all requests to stop participating in KPMP are cessations, meaning that the participant no longer wishes to continue conducting KPMP activities in the future, but is OK allowing their existing KPMP record to be used. If the participant instead expresses desire for their existing KPMP record not to be used, the Recruitment Site should reach out to the Central Hub to discuss a possible retraction withdrawal.


Unless explicitly requested otherwise by the participant, KPMP will retain any collected data and baseline biosamples.
If a cessation is marked, the individual will no longer be treated as an Active KPMP participant:

- They will be excluded from future KPMP communications (e.g., study update letters, Town Hall invitations, etc.).

- Reports and metrics will be amended to remove this participant as expected for follow-ups.
If, following communication with the Central Hub, a retraction withdrawal is determined, the two criteria above apply. Additionally, measures will be taken to exclude the participant’s KPMP record from new studies.

- Note: Participants are informed during the consenting process that data/specimens previously collected and already used in research cannot be withdrawn nor destroyed. For instance, it is not possible to destroy all sample remnants and information already distributed or analyzed in the public data lake.

- Note: Existing datasets, including data from withdrawn participants, will remain available to promote reproducibility of research, a NIH priority.

- Note: Participants are informed during the consenting process that their name and basic contact information will never be destroyed, even after withdrawal, due to regulatory requirements (e.g., as part of archived consent forms); however, the information will be maintained with the utmost security.

- Stored biospecimens that have not been analyzed or distributed to qualified researchers can be destroyed.
Investigator-Driven Withdrawal It is also possible that a consented participant be removed by the investigator prior to the KPMP biopsy.
This is most likely to happen due to a loss of eligibility or loss of contact. This scenario is described in the informed consent document. It states that the KPMP team may take a participant out of KPMP if necessary for the participant’s safety, and that the participant will be informed if this happens.
Reason(s) for removal will be documented in the End of Study CRF in the Participant Management Program (PMP). If possible, have a dialogue with the participant about what to expect next:

- The biopsy will not proceed 
- KPMP will retain any collected data and baseline biosamples, unless explicitly requested otherwise. If the participant does request data/sample removal, the record is treated as described above in the retraction withdrawal section.
After a withdrawal of any type, the participant’s data folder is clearly marked to indicate withdrawal and is maintained at the Recruitment Site where the participant was recruited and followed. No new data or samples will be collected.
The participant’s records will be flagged to show that the participant withdrew and indicate if any further contact by study staff is permitted.
Withdrawal following Progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) If a participant progresses to ESRD, their active participation in KPMP will be stopped. The recruitment site should attempt to complete one final remote visit with the participant and then withdraw the participant. The participant should be offered opportunities to remain engaged in KPMP, using the KPMP Kidney Failure Communication Letter to facilitate the conversation. Following withdrawal, the participant will not be directly contacted for data or biosamples collection, but in some cases, outcomes can be tracked using national registries and databases.
Forms to complete in REDCap:

- Participant Followup [Interview the participant]

  - Indicate ‘location of follow-up visit’ as ‘remote’ regardless of the target visit window (i.e. even if the participant is due for the 24 month in-person visit, all ESRD Withdrawal visits collect only the visit components associated with remote visits. Select remote.).

- Contact Information [Interview the participant]

  - It is prudent to review/update the participant and healthcare provider contact information (e.g. the participant may wish to continue receiving study update letters in the mail following withdrawal) 
- Medications Inventory [Interview the participant, verify from chart]

- Follow-up Medical Events [Interview the participant]

  - This CRF includes questions on chronic dialysis that need to be collected from ESRD participants 
- Post Biopsy Re-hospitalization [Interview the participant]

  - Complete if applicable 
- Participant Experience Survey [Participant completes independently]

  - Offer to the participant if timepoint is applicable 
- Laboratory Results [Coordinator to complete independently, from the chart]

- End of Study [Coordinator to complete independently]

  - Mark Participant Status as ‘Withdrew from study’ and that withdrawal was ‘Investigator-driven’. Indicate participant preferences for future communication. For ‘Reason participant withdrew from study’ select ‘Progression to ESRD’.
Do not complete the personal history follow-up, participant reported outcomes, or health literacy forms.
Do not conduct physical measurements or collect blood or urine samples.
Be sure to close the visit by going through the KPMP Kidney Failure Communication Letter to outline participant options for continued engagement. Ensure the participant knows they are appreciated and that the KPMP team remains a supportive resource for them.


## 4.6. Tracking retention of the study population For each visit, the following metrics will be reported:

- the number of participants who have withdrawn 
- the number of participants that attended within the visit window 
- the number of participants that attended but out-of-window 
- the number who only provided information over the phone 
- the number tracked only through passive (non-contact) surveillance 
- the number of participants for whom no information was obtained.
- Among those not able to contact, summaries of how many have not had any information obtained within 1 and 2 years respectively.


While the ideal participation level is complete, we recognize that there may be situations where participants miss visits, leave questionnaires incomplete, or do not provide biosamples at the desired timepoints. Any and all data collected will be leveraged to maximize the participant’s contribution and missing data will not preclude future participation if a participant has previously been considered lost to follow-up due to missed visits. Rather, attempts will be made to recapture information about the intervening time period to the greatest extent possible.


If a participant death is discovered, update the End of Study CRF to indicate that the participant has died, and attempt to record the date and cause of death, if possible. The Safety and Adjudication Committee reviews death that occur within 28-days of the kidney biopsy. Deaths that occur more than 

28-days after biopsy are not reviewed by the SAC. The End of Study form should only be used to update final status change, such as loss of eligibility, death, withdrawal, or lost-to-follow-up. Note that “participant in hospice” is included as a reason for follow-up not completed, but it is not a final status used to indicate an End of Study.


## 4.7. Tracking Participant Contact 
When participants are contacted outside of the scheduled remote and in-person visits, log the contact date in the REDCap Participant Contact CRF. In the CRF, record the date when biopsy results are provided, participant portal access is granted, KPMP update letters are provided, and ad hoc phone calls occur.


# 5. KPMP Study Process 
## 5.1. Visit Schedule Information 
This section of the manual provides a summary of activities and procedures that occur at each scheduled KPMP Study visit and contact.


Table 2 describes the types of visits and permissible visit intervals (visit windows) used throughout this manual to describe interaction with KPMP Study participants. Visits completed outside the visit window will be recorded as a protocol deviation. The scheduling generator application, which is a tool available in the REDCap Participant Management Program, generates contact windows based on the date of the Biopsy Visit. Contact windows define the period during which a visit is considered on time. Every effort should be made to conduct study visits at regular intervals.


Several tools are available to assist in organizing the required procedures, tests and CRFs associated with each visit and contact. Each KPMP Study visit has an accompanying checklist, which lists procedures for each clinic visit or telephone contact (See Appendix D). Tables 3 and 4a provide lists of KPMP CRFs by visit. Procedures and accompanying CRFs for each participant contact are included in the following sections. Daily clinical and biospecimen collection for AKI participants are summarized in table 4b.

**Blood and spot urine collection should be captured between day 5 and 7 post biopsy. Participants who have samples collected as inpatients on Day 5 and are then discharged satisfy this criterion.
Participants who are discharged on Day 4 or earlier will have a clinic or home study visit between Days 5 & 7 to obtain these samples (up to 14 days is allowable with a protocol deviation).

## 5.2. Screening Activities 
Screening activities include assessment of study eligibility and providing participants with information about the study. Site investigators should be available to answer any questions or provide additional information to those considering KPMP participation. Participant contact may occur on the telephone or in-person.


Determining eligibility is a multiple step process involving the review of medical information, evaluation of screening labs, participant conversation at a screening visit or phone call, and conference with the participant’s healthcare team and the KPMP PI. Eligibility assessment also continues post-consent; some exclusion criteria are dynamic (e.g. blood pressure, bleeding risk factors, etc.) and others may be unknown until the pre-biopsy imaging (e.g. solitary kidney, kidney depth, etc.). Factors that change post-consent but pre-biopsy will result in the patient being withdrawn due to loss of eligibility. Whether or not this change in eligibility status constitutes a protocol deviation is described in section 3.5. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in section 2.2.


Screening Activities include the following steps:


### 5.2.1. Tracking Pre-screening Activities:
CRF: New Participant CRF Pre-screening eligibility Information collected from the medical record or other sources prior to meeting with the participant can be recorded on the Screening Worksheet (see appendix F), or via local spreadsheets or databases. All necessary and relevant screening information will not be available from the medical record. However, even partial review of the information included in the Screening Worksheet should help determine whether a participant is potentially eligible or ineligible for the study.
The Screening Worksheet may contain personal identifying information and is not entered in the PMP. It is strictly a tool for gathering information to assess and contact participants. It is not essential to answer all questions. Store these forms in a locked file cabinet.
Participant Registration Tools are described in section 11.3.
A screening consent form is available to facilitate the collection of biospecimens to determine eligibility, if needed.
For AKI: Potential participants are added to REDCap if they meet inclusion criteria. Document exclusions for pre-screening failures in the New Participant CRF.
For CKD: Potential participants are added to REDCap if they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and are considered by the site investigator.
For participants who are quickly eliminated, record the reason in the New Participant CRF by selecting “yes” for “Was the participant excluded through pre-screening criteria?” and choose the outcome “Not approached – did not meet pre-screening criteria”. Select one or more reasons for ineligibility and fill out the demographic information.
For participants who pass pre-screening criteria, select “proceed with screening” or select an appropriate “Not approached” reason.
Table 5 describes in detail the flow of CRFs and participant status updates used for the pre-enrollment screening and eligibility process. Demographics and the results of approaching the potential participant are entered in the New Participant CRF.


### 5.2.2. Eligibility Assessment Activities:
CRF: Eligibility Assessment If a potential participant passes prescreening, request permission from their Primary kidney care physician to discuss the KPMP Study.
KPMP investigators will contact participants either by phone or in person to determine interest and eligibility for the study.
Once the participant is approached for participation, begin collecting information in the Eligibility Assessment CRF. Items in the Eligibility Assessment CRF that will be assessed later can be marked as “Unknown.”
In Eligibility Assessment CRF, if entering data for someone pre-consent no procedure dates will be collected. Until the informed consent form is signed and recorded in the Consent CRF, no PHI can be entered in the Eligibility Assessment or New Participant CRFs.

- After consent, previously hidden PHI fields are visible. Return to the Eligibility Assessment and New Participant CRFs to enter dates and other PHI after the consent is signed.
- If the participant does not consent, leave the fields blank 
- Use the 'Incomplete' form status to leave the form status red until consent decision is reached, providing a visual reminder to back to enter data. After entering PHI data, update the form status to “complete.”


For AKI participants: If the AKI RS PI believes that the Baseline serum creatinine under or over-estimates baseline, AKI site PIs may agree upon (by unanimous vote) a consensus Baseline serum creatinine. The AKI Site PI will email the other AKI RSs (copying kpmpdcc@uw.edu) to provide de-identified serum creatinine trend graphs, a clinical description, and any additional details needed to make a decision. If PIs for all sites agree, the vote and consensus baseline serum creatinine will be noted in the REDCap Eligibility Assessment, and enrollment can proceed if all other inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.


If the Research Coordinator is unable to make a determination of ineligible or not ineligible based on the information collected from the medical record and participant interview, the PI should be consulted, and additional sources of information may need to be reviewed.


If lab tests are needed to confirm eligibility prior to enrollment, complete Screening Consent Form to procure small quantities of blood/urine exclusively for the purposes of verifying labs for assessing eligibility criteria. This is prior to/separate from the main study consent. These samples are not retained for KPMP purposes. Completion of the Screening Consent Form is tracked locally and not in REDCap. If the patient does not meet a criterion, they are a “Screen Failure” and not pursued for enrollment.


If imaging and anatomic exclusion criteria are unknown, the Eligibility Assessment form can still be completed and the patient can be approached for consent. Those factors will be reviewed on pre-biopsy imaging. Factors that change post-consent but pre-biopsy will result in the patient being withdrawn due to loss of eligibility. See Figure 2 for an illustration of this eligibility workflow.


No further information will be collected about participants deemed ineligible. No further study activities will proceed.
If an eligible potential participant refuses to participate in the study, record the refusal reason on the Consent CRF. Eligible participants that agree to participate are scheduled for an Enrollment Visit.


Schedule participants for the Enrollment Visit as soon as possible, although there are no restrictions or time limits to this interval.


Provide instructions for the Enrollment Visit to the participant. Instruct participants to bring all recent [within the last 30 days] prescription and non-prescription medications with them to the Enrollment Visit so that they can be identified for collection of medication information.


### 5.2.3. Rescreening Activities:
Biopsies should be scheduled within 6 weeks of baseline biosample collections for CKD and within 48 hours for AKI. If CKD baseline biosamples are collected and the biopsy is not completed within 6 weeks (per the BS MOP), new blood and urine samples can be collected and recorded in a new instance of the Biosample CRFs. Click the '+' icon to create a new instance of the CRF. Do NOT overwrite old data. 

Tables 1 and 2 in the Biospecimen MOP describe timelines for collecting baseline samples. If new biosamples are collected for rescreening activities, both the new and old samples should be shipped to the CBR.


For previously consented participants who are re-approached, check over any previously entered CRFs and overwrite any old data with updates. For example, when re-assessing eligibility criteria, if anything has changed from the first evaluation, overwrite (i.e. replace) the old data in the Eligibility Assessment with new. Note the exception to this overwriting rule is the biosample collection forms -- if re-collecting blood and urine, do NOT overwrite the original form (because the old blood and urine are sent to the CBR). Instead, use the + icon to add another copy of the form as noted above).


## 5.3. Enrollment Visit The Enrollment Visit requires one or more in-person clinic visit(s) to complete the following study components and procedures:
### 5.3.1. Provide Visit Date and Participant time burden CRF: 
Visit Log 


### 5.3.2. Continued Assessment of inclusion/Exclusion Criteria CRF: 
Eligibility Assessment CRF If lab tests are needed to confirm eligibility prior to enrollment, complete Screening Consent Form.


In Eligibility Assessment CRF, if entering data for someone pre-consent, select "no” for “Did participant sign consent?” which allows for data entry without procedure dates. Until the informed consent form is signed and recorded in the Consent CRF, no PHI can be entered in the Eligibility Assessment CRF.


- After consent, change “Did participant sign consent” to “yes”, which allows for entry of previously hidden PHI fields. Return to the Eligibility Assessment CRF to enter dates and other PHI after the consent is signed.
- If the participant does not consent, leave the fields blank 
- Use the 'Incomplete' form status to leave the form status red until consent decision is reached, providing a visual reminder to back to enter data. After entering PHI data, update the form status to “complete.”


Bleeding criteria screening and urine pregnancy tests (if necessary) are completed up to two weeks prior to biopsy for CKD participants, or up to 48 hours prior to biopsy for AKI. These tests may be completed at the Enrollment or Biopsy Visit. If exclusion criteria are discovered now, the biopsy should not proceed. Either delay the biopsy and re-test to determine if the criteria have stabilized, or remove the participant from the study. If the exclusion criterion was knowable prior to consent, this is categorized as a Minor Deviation; if it was not knowable, it is “withdrawal due to loss of eligibility”. See Figure 2 for details.


If necessary, place an order to collect bleeding criteria screening labs prior to the Biopsy Visit.


Women who are pre-pubertal, post-menopausal, or with other medical reasons for permanent, irreversible infertility do not require a pregnancy test. If the participant is not of child-bearing potential, record “No” for the pregnancy test completion question on the Eligibility Assessment.


### 5.3.3. Informed Consent Process CRF: 
Informed Consent After confirming initial eligibility, participants will sign and date the informed consent form (if not previously completed) in either English or Spanish. Spanish-speaking participants must sign a Spanish-translated IRB-approved version of the informed consent form. A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to the participant. The original signed consent form should be placed in the participant’s study file and/or added to the EHR. A second copy should be placed in a confidential study folder containing copies of consents for all study participants and/or uploaded to the participant EHR as required locally. If a potential participant needs more time to review and complete the ICF, Enrollment Visit study procedures can be completed during an additional study visit after the ICF is signed.


Return to the New Participant and Eligibility CRFs to update PHI data after the ICF is signed.


See instructions in section 3.4.2 for LAR consent procedures for open biopsies. For open biopsies, "Was consent signed?" includes response options Participant signed consent form, LAR signed consent form, and Consent not signed. If LAR signed consent, obtain consent from participant when they regain capacity and complete "Did participant sign consent?" question. If yes, collect date. Do not complete the 3 month visit without participant consent.


Following the completion of the informed consent process, a set of data and biosamples should be collected from the participant prior to biopsy. These activities together constitute the remainder of the Enrollment Visit and are described in sections 5.3.4 – 5.3.13 below. Continue assessing the participant for eligibility throughout this process. Do not proceed with the biopsy if any eligibility criteria failures are discovered.


### 5.3.4. Collect Contact Information CRF: 
Participant Contact Interview the participant to complete the Participant Contact CRF. Participant Contact CRF information should be reviewed and updated during each subsequent visit Encourage participants to provide an email address to receive web links to confidential participant experience surveys after the 28-day and 6-month phone visits. An email address is also required to access the participant portal where they may view their biopsy whole slide images.


### 5.3.5. Collect Medications Inventory CRF: 
Medications Complete the Medications CRF by reviewing all prescription and non-prescription medications that participant has taken in the last 30 days. Best practice is to get the information from the participant and then follow up with chart review to ensure that everything is captured.

Record the medications, noting total daily dose, unit, frequency and route, on the Medications CRF.
Review the EHR for any missing medications or details.
For AKI participants, record medications from 30-days prior to enrollment, during the biopsy procedure, and until hospital discharge.


### 5.3.6. Record Medical History CRFs: 
Participant Medical History, Coordinator Medical History The Participant Medical History CRF is interview administered by the Research Coordinator. If participants have difficulty answering a question, instruct them to make their best estimate rather than leave a response blank. Questionnaires can be finished by phone interview if necessary (or at the 3-month visit for AKI participants). Information recorded in the Participant Medical History CRF may be updated or verified by the Research Coordinator through reviewing the EHR.


Complete the Coordinator Medical History form by reviewing data and uploading images from the EHR.


### 5.3.7. Participant Administered Questionnaires CRFs: 
Demographics, Personal History, Health Literacy, Participant Reported Outcomes Participant-administered CRFs are completed on paper either during the Enrollment Visit, or at home and returned at the biopsy visit. If completed in person, ensure that the participant has quiet space to complete the form where they won’t be distracted or rushed. Let the participant know how to contact the research coordinator in case questions come up as they complete the forms.


AKI participants may complete the forms at their 3-month visit if time or circumstances do not allow during their hospitalization.


Formatted PDF versions of the participant-administered questionnaires are available to download and print from Basecamp in English and Spanish.


When entering paper CRFs into REDCap, one research coordinator enters the data and selects the form status “unverified.” A second staff member should check that that the data entry is correct and then update the form status to “complete.”


### 5.3.8. Physical Exam CRF: 
Physical Measurements Complete physical measurements including height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and edema assessment, recording the measurements on the Physical Measurements CRF. Blood pressures are measured following the procedure outlined in Appendix C of this manual. Record the pulse and 3 sequential BP measurements while the participant is seated, followed by the pulse and one BP measurement while standing (if possible).


### 5.3.9. Biospecimen Collection CRFs: 
Biospecimen CRF for Blood, Spot Urine, Timed Urine, Stool, and Biopsy/ACD Scheduling CRF Samples should be collected as close to the biopsy as possible (up to 6 weeks before the biopsy for CKD participants, or up to 48 hours before the biopsy for AKI participants). See the Biospecimen MOP for additional details. No specimens may be collected until eligibility is confirmed and the ICF is signed.


If the participant is determined to be ineligible after the informed consent form is signed and after baseline biospecimens (blood, urine, stool) are collected, the samples should still be sent to the CBR unless explicitly requested otherwise by the participant. Record the reason for ineligibility in the End of Study CRF. See section 3.5 for details on determining whether this qualifies as a deviation.


If an ACD tube is going to be drawn, record the planned date of ACD tube collection in the Biopsy Scheduling CRF ASAP to notify the biorepository in advance. Record scheduled biopsy date, if known.


At the end of the Enrollment Visit, both AKI and CKD participants are given supplies for collecting a timed urine and stool specimen along with instructions for completing the specimen collection and returning it to the clinic at the Biopsy Visit. See the Biospecimen MOP for additional details.


### 5.3.10. Pre-biopsy Clinical Assessment CRFs: 
Clinician and Investigator Pre-biopsy Clinical Assessment The KPMP PI and a member of the participant care team will complete the Pre-biopsy Clinician Assessment before knowing the results of the kidney biopsy. The CRF provides an option to track cases where no renal tissue was obtained, and pathology results are not expected. Research Coordinators may need to facilitate completion of the CRFs by providing the paper version and subsequently entering the responses into the REDCap PMP. When entering paper CRFs into REDCap, one research coordinator enters the data and selects the form status “unverified.” A second staff member should check that that the data entry is correct and then update the form status to “complete.”
Research Coordinators can send clinicians an email containing a URL link to complete the Pre-biopsy Clinician Assessment CRF as a web-survey using the “Send Clinician Pre-Clinical Assessment” CRF.


### 5.3.11. Laboratory Results CRF: 
Laboratory Results Complete the Laboratory Results CRF using EHR data after the Enrollment Visit.


For AKI participants, enter creatinine and urine protein measures from before the current hospitalization in the Laboratory Results CRF. Creatinine and urine protein measures from the enrollment hospitalization should be recorded in the AKI Daily Measures CRF.
Do not record sCr values that were taken while the participant was receiving dialysis.


### 5.3.12. AKI Hospitalization Data CRFs: 
AKI Hospitalization CRF, AKI Daily Progress CRF, AKI Daily Measures, AKI Adjudication CRF Site investigators complete the Daily Progress Note for AKI participants on the day of enrollment and then daily until hospital discharge.


Research Coordinators complete the Daily Measures and AKI Hospitalization CRF for AKI participants on the day of enrollment and daily until hospital discharge.
The site investigator, together with a small quorum of KPMP AKI investigators, will complete phase one of the two-step ‘AKI Adjudication’ process within 72 hours of enrollment. The investigators will convene and complete the Adjudication Report, with the aim of standardizing etiology across sites. Phase two is described in Section 5.4.


### 5.3.13. Update Participant Status CRFs: 
Participant Status or End of Study Update the Participant Status CRF to indicate any updates (changing from “Screening in progress” to failed screening, passed screening but participant still deciding, passed screening but did not consent, or participant consented and enrolled.


Once a participant is classified as “consented and enrolled,” further updates to study status such as completed or withdrew from study, deceased, lost to follow-up, or loss of eligibility are recorded in the End of Study CRF. If after enrollment a participant is found to be ineligible (due to laboratory results or other conditions), report them as “Loss of eligibility” in the End of Study CRF.


If a participant is enrolled as eligible and has signed the informed consent form, but later fails safety criteria and can't have the biopsy, all collected biosamples should be kept and sent to CBR unless requested otherwise by the participant. Record the reason for ineligibility in the End of Study CRF.


If the participant is found ineligible after consent and study activities begin, be transparent with participants. Explain what happened. Determine whether samples and data may be kept or if the participant would like them destroyed. Have these conversations in-person if possible instead of sending a letter, to allow participants to ask questions. Details and logistics of these communication are left to sites to allow sites to do what’s best for them.


## 5.4. Biopsy Visit The Biopsy Visit requires one or more in-person clinic visit(s) to complete the following study components and procedures:
### 5.4.1. Provide Visit Date and Participant time burden CRF: Visit Log 
### 5.4.2. Review Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria CRFs: 
Eligibility Assessment and Pre-Biopsy Safety Review bleeding exclusion criteria blood tests and pregnancy test (for women less than 55 years old).


Remind participants that they may take their prescribed blood pressure medication with a sip of water on the day of the biopsy.


Women who are pre-pubertal, post-menopausal, or with other medical reasons for permanent, irreversible infertility do not require a pregnancy test. If the participant is not of child-bearing potential, record “N/A” for the pregnancy question on the Pre-Biopsy Safety CRF.


If these factors have changed and render the participant ineligible, either re-test and re-schedule the biopsy for a later date when factors may again meet criteria, or withdraw the participant due to loss of eligibility (End of Study CRF).


### 5.4.3. Participant Administered Questionnaires CRFs: 
Demographics, Personal History, Health Literacy, Participant Reported Outcomes Receive participant administered CRFs if they were completed on paper at home and returned at the biopsy visit.


When entering paper CRFs into REDCap, one research coordinator enters the data and selects the form status “unverified.” A second staff member should check that that the data entry is correct and then update the form status to “complete.”


AKI participants may complete the forms at their 3-month visit if time or circumstances do not allow during their hospitalization.


### 5.4.4. Biospecimen Collection CRFs: 
Biospecimen CRF Timed Urine and Stool and Laboratory Results Record the received timed urine and stool samples and process according to instructions in Biospecimen MOP.


For AKI participants, order urine microscopy from the clinical lab and record the results in the Laboratory Results CRF.


### 5.4.5. Update Contact Information CRF: 
Participant Contact Review all participant and healthcare provider contact information, making the appropriate updates.


### 5.4.6. Complete Pre-Biopsy Safety Checklist CRF: 
Pre-Biopsy Safety The Pre-Biopsy Safety CRF must be completed in REDCap before the start of the biopsy. The paper copy is available to give you flexibility to get the data from the operator, but it MUST be transcribed into REDCap BEFORE the biopsy so the system can check the data and flag (red banner) if the participant hasn't passed safety criteria.


An electronic signature field at the end of the CRF must be signed by both the operator and an authorized investigator.
If these factors have changed and render the participant ineligible, either re-test and re-schedule the biopsy for a later date when factors may again meet criteria, or withdraw the participant due to loss of eligibility (End of Study CRF).


### 5.4.7. Perform Kidney Biopsy CRF:

End of Study Record any study status updates (withdrew from study, deceased, lost to follow-up, loss of eligibility, etc.) in the End of Study CRF.


### 5.5. 24-hour Post Biopsy Phone Call 
The primary purpose of the 24-hour phone call is to collect details of any adverse events that occurred since the biopsy visit. For this visit, collect details of adverse events since the participant’s biopsy. Visit windows are 12-48 hours after biopsy. The Participant Management Program provides for a calendar application to assist in scheduling participants. If the participant wishes, telephone visits can be completed in-person without being considered a protocol deviation.


The 24-hour Post Biopsy Phone call includes the following steps:


### 5.5.1. Provide Visit Date and Participant time burden CRF: 
Visit Log 

### 5.5.2. Record 24-Hours Post-Biopsy Call Status CRFs: 
24 Hour Participant Follow-up, Adverse Events Record the status of the follow-up call. If the call is not done and staff are still working to reach the participant, the CRF status should remain as “attempted” until the visit window closes (see table 2). If the call is not completed before the visit window closes, record the status as not done, enter the date when it was determined that the call would not occur, and record the reason.


If after leaving messages and calling repeatedly the follow up cannot be obtained, the call status is recorded as “participant unable” and “could not locate.”
If a death, withdrawal, or other End of Study status update is discovered within the visit window, update the 24-Hour Participant Follow-up CRF to indicate that the call will not be completed and enter the reason. Also update the End of Study CRF.


If a response on the CRF indicates an Adverse Event, report the AE in the KPMP Adverse Events Reporting REDCap project. If a “yes” response for “Did you experience any other complications from the biopsy procedure that you noticed” indicates to an adverse event, record the ID of the AE in the 24-hour Participant Follow-up CRF after it is entered in the KPMP Adverse Events Reporting REDCap project.


### 5.5.3. Record Post Biopsy Re-hospitalizations CRF: 
Post Biopsy Re-hospitalization If the participant was re-hospitalized after being discharged from their KPMP hospitalization, collect the details in the Post Biopsy Re-hospitalization CRF.

The CRFs will trigger an email to the local pathologist with a link to complete the Pathology IF Metadata and Dx Core Disease Category Assignment CRFs. Pathologists need to have these survey links when they complete the diagnostic workup for the biopsy tissue.


## 5.6. 5-7 day AKI Specimen Collection 
AKI participants require blood and urine specimen collection at least one time within the timeframe 5 to 7 days after biopsy. Participants who have samples collected as inpatients on Day 5 and are then discharged satisfy this criterion. Participants who are discharged on Day 4 or earlier will have a clinic or home study visit between Days 5 & 7 to obtain these samples. During this contact, also collect details of adverse events since the participant’s biopsy. Specimen collection window is 5-7 days after biopsy, but it can be completed up to 14 days after the biopsy with submission of a protocol deviation. The Participant Management Program provides for a calendar application to assist in scheduling participants.
The 5-7 day AKI Post Biopsy Specimen Collection includes the following steps:


### 5.6.1. Provide Date and Participant time burden CRF:

### 5.8.3. Record Post Biopsy Re-hospitalizations CRF: 
Post Biopsy Re-hospitalization If the participant was re-hospitalized after being discharged from their KPMP hospitalization, collect the details in the Post Biopsy Re-hospitalization CRF.


### 5.8.4. Collect Participant Experience Survey CRFs: 
Participant Experience Survey and Send the Participant Experience Survey CRF During the 28-day phone call, remind the participant that KPMP would like to send an email link to a confidential Participant Experience survey. If an email address was not provided at a previous visit, ask for an email address where the participant could receive a link to the survey.
After completing the 28-day follow-up CRF, select the “send the participant experience survey” CRF button from the REDCap PMP dashboard:


In the CRF, enter the date and confirm the email address listed for the participant. If it needs updating, enter the new email address on the Contact Information CRF.
Confirm the email address, select the Spanish or English version of the CRF, select “yes” to send the survey, mark CRF as complete, and save and exit the CRF. REDCap will automatically send an email to the participant with a link to the survey once you save and exit the CRF.


Completion status for the emailed Participant Experience Survey can be viewed from within the “Send the Participant Experience Survey” CRF. After receiving the survey email and link, the participant will be sent weekly reminders for three weeks reminding them to complete the survey. After 4 weeks, CDCC queries will prompt Research Coordinators to contact participants about missing surveys.


If the participant does not have an email address, print a paper PDF copy of the CRF in the participant’s preferred language (English or Spanish) from Basecamp and mail it to the participant with a stamped envelope addressed to:
KPMP CDCC University of Washington Bldg29, Suite 310 
6200 74th Street NE Seattle, WA 98115 CDCC staff will enter the survey data into the REDCap PMP.

Make note of the date/format when the biopsy results are shared with the participant in the Participant Contact log.


### 5.9. 3-month AKI Visit The 3-month AKI Visit serves as a baseline out-patient visit for AKI participants. 
Some of the procedures collected for CKD participants at the Biopsy Visit are completed at the 3-month visit for AKI participants, if there was not opportunity during the AKI hospitalization: Physical Measurements, Participant Reported Outcomes, Health Literacy, Personal History.


Begin contacting AKI participants 1 month prior to their target 3-month AKI Visit date. Visit windows are minus and plus 1 month of the target date; therefore, contacting participants early in the visit window allows for maximum flexibility in reaching participants by phone or time to locate missing participants.


REDCap provides for a calendar application to assist in scheduling participants.


If a legally authorized representative (LAR) provided consent, participant consent must be obtained before the 3-month visit.


The 3-month AKI Visit includes the following steps:


### 5.9.1. Provide Visit Date and Participant time burden CRF: 
Visit Log 


### 5.9.2. Record 3-month Visit Status CRF: 
3-Month Participant Follow-up Prior to the in-clinic visit, remind participants to bring all prescription and non-prescription medications taken in the past 30 days and (preferably) any completed at-home questionnaires.


Record the status of the 3-month visit. If the call is not done and staff are still working to reach the participant, select “Followup attempted but hasn’t occurred yet” in the CRF and record the date, method, and outcome of the attempt. Once the contact occurs, or it has been determined that it will not occur (including if the visit window closes, see table 2), change the response for "Did this follow-up occur?" to reflect the proper outcome.


If the visit did not occur, enter the date when it was determined that the visit would not occur, and record the reason. If after leaving messages and calling repeatedly the follow-up can still not be completed, the visit status is recorded as “participant unable” and “could not locate.”


If a death, withdrawal, or other End of Study status update is discovered within the visit window, update the Visit Status CRF to indicate that the visit will not be completed and enter the reason. Also update the End of Study CRF 


### 5.9.3. Update Contact Information CRF: 
Participant Contact Review all participant and healthcare provider contact information, making the appropriate updates.


### 5.9.4. Collect Medications Inventory CRF: 
Medications Complete the Medications CRF by reviewing all prescription and non-prescription medications that participant has taken in the last 30 days. Best practice is to get the information from the participant and then follow up with chart review to ensure that everything is captured.


Record the medications, noting total daily dose, unit, frequency and route, on the Medications CRF.


Review the EHR for any missing medications or details.


If a previous medication is reported with a new dose or frequency, mark the medication as stopped at the previous dose and create a new instance of the CRF for starting the medication at the new dose or frequency.


### 5.9.5. Record Medical History CRFs: 
Participant Medical History, Coordinator Medical History To be completed at the 3-month AKI visit if no information was provided during the Enrollment Visit.


The Participant Medical History CRF is interview administered by the Research Coordinator. If participants have difficulty answering a question, instruct them to make their best estimate rather than leave a response blank. Questionnaires can be finished by phone interview if necessary. Information recorded in the Medical History Participant CRF may be updated or verified by the Research Coordinator through reviewing the EHR.


The Coordinator Medical History form is reviewing data and uploading images from the EHR.


### 5.9.6. Record Post Biopsy Re-hospitalizations CRF:

Participant-administered CRFs are completed on paper either during the visit, or at home and returned at the 3-month visit. If completed in person, ensure that the participant has quiet space to complete the form where they won’t be distracted or rushed. Let the participant know how to contact the research coordinator in case questions come up as they complete the forms.


When entering paper CRFs into REDCap, one research coordinator enters the data and selects the form status “unverified.” A second staff member should check that that the data entry is correct and then update the form status to “complete.”


### 5.9.8. Physical Exam CRF: 
Physical Measurements Complete physical measurements including height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and edema assessment, recording the measurements on the Physical Measurements CRF. Blood pressures are measured following the procedure outlined in Appendix C of this manual.

End of Study Complete any necessary updates to study status such as completed or withdrew from study, deceased, lost to follow-up, or loss of eligibility are recorded in the End of Study CRF.


## 5.10. Remote Visits R1-5 (6, 18, 30, 42, 54 months) 
Remote telephone visits start 6 months after the Biopsy Visit and continue 6 months after each in-person clinic visit to keep participants engaged and to collect data regarding medical events and hospitalizations. If the participant wishes, telephone visits can be completed in-person without being considered a protocol deviation.


Begin contacting participants 2 months prior to their target Remote Visit date. Visit windows are minus and plus 2 months of the target date. Contacting participants early in the visit window allows for maximum flexibility in reaching participants by phone or time to locate missing participants. REDCap provides a calendar application to assist in scheduling participants.


A visit is considered “late” when it is conducted outside the original two-month window dates. A visit is considered “missing” if it does not occur before the next visit window has opened.
Each remote visit is an opportunity to discuss the KPMP Study schedule with the participant and to remind them about the next upcoming clinic visit. Consider scheduling the next clinic visit and tests at this time if the participant is willing to do so.


Remote Visit Phone calls include the following steps:


### 5.10.1. Provide Visit Date and Participant time burden CRF: 
Visit Log 

### 5.10.2. Record Remote Visit Call Status CRF:

### 5.10.8. Collect Participant Experience Survey CRF: 
Participant Experience Survey and Send the Participant Experience Survey CRF There are three different Participant Experience Surveys: the 28 day, 6-month, and the annual. The 28-day and 6-month surveys are intended to be completed once, in association with their respective visits.


The annual survey is intended to be completed on a recurring annual basis, starting at the 18-month remote visit (and repeating at 30, 42, 54 month remote visits).
During the remote visit phone call, remind the participant that KPMP would like to send an email link to a confidential Participant Experience survey. If an email address was not provided at a previous visit, ask for an email address where the participant could receive a link to the survey.


Up to 3 attempts should be made to have the participant complete each survey. If the participant prefers, the survey can be completed at the next in-person visit (e.g. 6-month survey can be completed at the 12-month in-person visit, the 18-month survey can be completed at the 24-month in-person visit, etc.).


After completing the participant follow-up CRF, select the “send the participant experience survey” CRF button from the REDCap PMP dashboard:


In the CRF, enter the date and confirm the email address listed for the participant. If it needs updating, enter the new email address on the Contact Information CRF.
Confirm the email address, select the Spanish or English version of the CRF, select “yes” to send the survey, mark CRF as complete, and save and exit the CRF. REDCap will automatically send an email to the participant with a link to the survey once you save and exit the CRF.


Once the participant completes the survey, a green check appears in the radio button on the dashboard.


If the participant does not have an email address, print a paper PDF copy of the CRF in the participant’s preferred language (English or Spanish) from Basecamp and mail it to the participant with a stamped envelope addressed to:
KPMP CDCC University of Washington Bldg29, Suite 310 
6200 74th Street NE Seattle, WA 98115 CDCC staff will enter the survey data into the REDCap PMP.


### 5.10.9. Provide access to the Participant Portal at the remote 6 month visit 
Use the KPMP Participant Port Account Administration app at https://accounts.mydata.kpmp.org/accounts/accounts.htm to create a participant’s account and send their registration information. Additional details are available on Basecamp at https://3.basecamp.com/3770084/buckets/9084089/vaults/3958926972. Once participants register for an account, they may access the Participant Portal (https://mydata.kpmp.org/).


### 5.10.10. Update Participant Status CRF: 
End of Study Record any study status updates (withdrew from study, deceased, lost to follow-up, loss of eligibility, etc.) in the End of Study CRF.


## 5.11. Annual Follow-up Visits (12, 24, 36, 48 months) 
Annual in-person visits start 12 months after the Biopsy Visit. Begin contacting participants 3 months prior to their target Annual Visit date. Visit windows are minus and plus 3 months of the target date.


Contacting participants early in the visit window allows for maximum flexibility in reaching participants by phone or time to locate missing participants. REDCap provides a calendar application to assist in scheduling participants.


A visit is considered “late” when it is conducted outside the original three-month window dates. A visit is considered “missing” if it does not occur before the next visit window has opened.
If the participant has relocated to an area from which it is no longer feasible to travel to the clinical center (or is otherwise unable or unwilling to come to the clinic), the participant will be asked to permit study personnel to contact them annually by telephone or arrange for a home visit. Every effort should be made to encourage continued participation. The Research Coordinator should follow the format described for telephone contact. Strategies for adapting the annual visit for the remote setting are outlined in Section 4.2.
If a participant is unwilling to continue participating in the KPMP Study, try to engage the participant in the aspects of the study that can be accomplished during a brief visit or over the course of two visits.


Consider mailing questionnaires (Participant Reported Outcomes, Personal History) to the participant in advance of the Annual Follow-up Visit so they can be completed at home and returned during the visit.


During the 12 month in-person visit, check to see if 6-month participant experience survey has been completed. If not, provide a paper copy of the survey and a stamped envelope to return it to the DCC.


Record the survey attempt in the 6-month Send the Participant Experience Survey CRF. A similar process should be completed for the 18-month participant experience survey at the 24-month in-person visit, the 30-month participant experience survey at the 36-month in-person visit, etc.
In-person annual follow-up visits include the following steps:


### 5.11.1. Provide Visit Date and Participant time burden CRF: 
Visit Log 

### 5.11.2. Record Visit Status CRF: 
Participant Follow-up Record the status of the visit. If the visit is not done and staff are still working to reach the participant, select “Followup attempted but hasn’t occurred yet” in the CRF and record the date, method, and outcome of the attempt. Once the contact occurs, or it has been determined that it will not occur (including if the visit window closes, see table 2), change the response for "Did this follow-up occur?" to reflect the proper outcome.


If the visit did not occur, enter the date when it was determined that it would not occur, and record the reason. If after leaving messages and calling repeatedly the follow-up can still not be completed, the visit status is recorded as “participant unable” and “could not locate.”
If a death, withdrawal, or other End of Study status update is discovered within the visit window, update the Follow-up CRF to indicate that the visit will not be completed and enter the reason. Also update the End of Study CRF.

### 5.11.7. Participant-Administered Questionnaires CRFs: 
Personal History Follow-up, Participant Reported Outcomes, Health Literacy (12-month only) Participant-administered CRFs are completed on paper either during the visit, or at home and returned at the visit. If completed in person, ensure that the participant has quiet space to complete the form where they won’t be distracted or rushed. Let the participant know how to contact the research coordinator in case questions come up as they complete the forms.


PDF versions of participant-administered CRFs are available to download and print from Basecamp.


When entering paper CRFs into REDCap, one research coordinator enters the data and selects the form status “unverified.” A second staff member should check that that the data entry is correct and then update the form status to “complete.”


### 5.11.8. Physical Exam CRF: 
Physical Measurements Complete physical measurements including height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and edema assessment, recording the measurements on the Physical Measurements CRF. Blood pressures are measured following the procedure outlined in Appendix C of this manual. Record the pulse and 3 sequential BP measurements while the participant is seated, followed by the pulse and one BP measurement while standing (if possible).
If the Annual Follow-up Visit is completed remotely, check the EMR for data from within the visit window to complete the Physical Measurements CRF.


### 5.11.9. Biospecimen Collection CRF: 
Biospecimen CRF for Blood, Spot Urine See the Biospecimen MOP for additional details.


### 5.11.10. Laboratory Results CRF: 
Laboratory Results Complete the Laboratory Results CRF using EHR data since the last visit. If no new laboratory results are available since the last visit, enter “N/A, no new labs since last visit” for the question “Were all available lab values entered” at the end of each section of the CRF.


### 5.11.11. Update Participant Status CRFs: 
End of Study Record any study status updates (withdrew from study, deceased, lost to follow-up, loss of eligibility, etc.) in the End of Study CRF.


# 6. Case Report Forms 
## 6.1. Acquisition of the Forms 
The KPMP REDCap PMP provides electronic CRFs that can be completed on a tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. Back-up forms are available as paper Adobe portable document format (PDF) files. The PMP is the primary data collection source and printing paper forms in advance of a visit should not be necessary. PDFs of some of the CRFs are available to print on Basecamp. PDFs are available for forms whose completion process may be facilitated by a paper option (such as the Pre-Clinical Assessment for clinicians who may not have REDCap access, or the Personal History form for participants to complete privately), or by forms with critical timepoints that must be captured at a specific time and could be hindered by a technical error that blocked access to REDCap (namely, the Kidney Biopsy Procedure Details CRF).
Each PDF copy of a CRF has a name located in bold at the bottom right of the page. Each form is dated at the bottom left corner to identify the version of the CRF. This is important should a CRF be revised later.


## 6.2. General Instructions for the Completion of Case Report Forms Two types of forms are used in this study: Data Forms and Administrative Forms:

- Data Forms contain participant data that are entered in the PMP.

- Administrative Forms are used for processing Data Forms, tracking data flow and in scheduling study procedures and appointments.
All questions must be answered (all fields completed), as specified on the CRF. Be concise, however, avoid using abbreviations and symbols. Indicate “refused” for any questions unanswered. When the participant is not sure of an answer, they should use a “best estimate” rather than not answer the question.


The Research Coordinator is responsible for reviewing all the completed CRFs at the respective visits when recording data. All personal identifying information must be removed from lab or procedure reports prior to forwarding copies to the CDCC, if it is applicable/necessary for this to be done. All source documentation sent to the CDCC must have all personal identifying information redacted (“blacked out”) and replaced with the participant ID number. This is accomplished by photocopying the original document, blacking out the names or other identifying information, and then photocopying the blacked-out copy. These steps assure complete confidentiality.


At the time of data entry, the Research Coordinator ID will be automatically recorded for each CRF in the PMP. Review all CRFs for accuracy and completeness as they are entered in the PMP. The Visit Checklists will assist in documenting the review, entry, and verification process. If errors are found while reviewing the CRFs, the error should be updated directly in the CRF.


## 6.3. Participant Interview Completed Forms 
When completing the participant interview forms, clarify any participant responses that are unclear or incomplete. Ask the participant to elaborate or reconsider an incomplete or inappropriate answer without leading the participant or influencing the content of the answer to avoid creating a biased response.


Some questions addressed in the CRFs are personal and may be considered sensitive by the participant.


When a participant shows reluctance in answering a question, reassure the participant regarding the confidentiality of the response and explain the importance/purpose of the question.
Electronic medical records can be used to complete information in the Medical History or Medications CRFs if the participant is unsure of an answer or response, or if the participant’s response contradicts that which is provided in electronic medical record. In the event of a contradiction, use the information in the EMR.


## 6.4. Mode of Administration 
KPMP CRFs are completed by the Research Coordinator in clinic, or by the participant in either the clinic or at home. Table 6 lists the acceptable method of administration for each CRF. Less preferred but allowed options are noted with an “x” in parentheses.

# 7. Biopsy Procedure 
## 7.1. Procedure for Percutaneous Kidney Biopsy 
### 7.1.1. Operator Only licensed clinicians (nephrologists, radiologists, physician assistants, etc.) that are registered and approved by KPMP will perform the procedure. 
The operator should have a minimum experience of 35 biopsies over two years with an overall major complication rate (for example: bleeding requiring transfusions/surgery/additional interventions or death or extended hospitalization of more than 48hours) of <10% and >85% of biopsies adequate for diagnosis. The site PI should verify the credentials of the operators at that site on an ongoing basis. If the KPMP biopsy will be performed by a KPMP-certified physician’s assistant, they must be accompanied by a KPMP-certified physician.


All KPMP-certified biopsy operators (MDs and non-MDs) should 
- Ensure their medical staff bylaws allow their participation in research as a key provider 
- Be covered by hospital/institution insurance New operators can be certified by the site PI if they performed 35 biopsies under supervision over 2 years, with at least 25 biopsies as the primary operator.


### 7.1.2. Imaging Biopsies should be performed under direct image guidance and the passage of the needle should be visualized with real time ultrasound or CT.
The minimal ultrasound requirements will include:

- Ultrasound with Color Doppler flow capabilities 
- High frequency body probe (ideally >4MHz) 
- Image storage capabilities The minimal CT scanning requirement will include:
- Image storage Minimal imaging protocol will include:
- Real time ultrasound or CT-guidance will be used from needle insertion to acquisition of tissue (i.e. biopsy not to be performed blindly) 
- Post-biopsy images of the kidney will be obtained and saved 
- A perinephric hematoma that demonstrates active extravasation of blood will be compressed until extravasation has ceased.


Ultrasound images obtained will include:
- Images will be obtained pre-biopsy of both kidneys with Doppler flow as described above. This will help define the most avascular plane.
- Images with Doppler flow may be obtained after each pass of the biopsy needle, but it is not required.
- A post-biopsy image with Doppler flow will be obtained to:
  - Identify an extrarenal “jet” (a manifestation of active bleeding). If seen, ultrasound with color Doppler may be performed periodically over the next 15 minutes to document resolution of the jet (the most frequent finding) or a persistent jet and an expanding hematoma 
  - Identify post-biopsy arteriovenous fistula (manifested by focal high velocity flow along the needle pass. Potential AVFs would need to be assessed with spectral Doppler, in an ultrasound lab with appropriate expertise and equipment.
- Hematoma images will be measured in the largest dimension upon cessation of blood extravasation. Cessation of blood extravasation will be identified when the hematoma size has been stable on consecutive images as determined by radiology.
CT images obtained will include:
- Pre- and post-biopsy kidney images 
- Hematoma size will be measured All images will need to be saved on an institutional image server with the ability to transfer to the Central Hub, upon request.


### 7.1.3. Operative Techniques for Ultrasound-guided Biopsy 
Each Recruitment Site has established procedures for doing percutaneous native kidney biopsies that roughly follow the steps outlined below. Established local practices should be followed with KPMP guidelines in order to maximize application of local expertise and safety. The most important recommendation is that the clinician performing the biopsy be comfortable with their protocol and perform all the steps they routinely do during clinically indicated kidney biopsies to ensure a safe kidney biopsy for this research protocol. dDAVP may be administered at the discretion of the biopsy operator when judged to be useful to reduce bleeding risk.


1. Place participant in prone position with wedge under abdomen. Ensure participant can participate in procedure and hold breath when instructed.
2. Blood pressure and pulse should be monitored every 5-10 minutes during the procedure; if your center routinely monitors pulse oxygenation this should be monitored throughout the procedure.
3. Ultrasound both kidneys pre-biopsy. Identify which kidney is most appropriate for biopsy. This should be determined by the operator with direct visualization of the kidneys based on their experience. Factors entering in this decision include but are not limited to:
- Kidney Size and Depth (<13 cm, as measured perpendicular from the skin) 
- Thickness of cortex 
- Complicating features at lower pole (cysts, blood vessel, mass, hydronephrosis, solitary kidney, bowel, large flow vessels-assessed with doppler flow) 
- Proximity of lower pole to bowel 
- Proximity of inferior pole to rib 
4. Abort procedure if access to either kidney is not optimal 
5. Using real-time ultrasound, evaluate the kidney and identify view that allows best visualization of lower pole. Mark the site for biopsy. The participant needs to hold their breath while undergoing the kidney biopsy.
6. Sterilize the area (chlorhexidine or other).
7. Using sterile precautions (gown, gloves, mask, hairnet), ensure the area surrounding the biopsy site has sterile drapes so the biopsy can be performed using sterile technique. This should include a sterile probe cover for the ultrasound.
8. Apply local anesthetic (lidocaine or other) to the skin and then using real-time ultrasound guidance use a needle to infiltrate the anesthetic down to the capsule. Additionally, conscious sedation may be used at this point to ensure participant comfort during the procedure. (Caution with sedation should be taken to not affect the participant’s ability to follow breathing commands).
9. Optional: After local anesthesia has been achieved, use a scalpel to make a small incision in the skin at the marked spot.
10. Using real time ultrasound guidance insert a cylindrical 16-gauge biopsy needle to just above the kidney capsule (1-1.5mm above the capsule). Ensure the needle tip can be visualized.
11. Ask the participant to hold their breath and deploy the biopsy needle.
12. Remove the biopsy needle. The participant can now breathe normally.
13. Follow the tissue processing steps described in the Pathology MOP.
14. Repeat steps 10-13 for each additional biopsy core.
15. Limit number of passes to 5 and 3 cores; distribution between clinical and research is described in the Pathology MOP.
16. After the last core has been obtained, apply pressure to biopsy site until bleeding stops from the surface needle insertion site (~5 minutes).
17. Perform a post-biopsy ultrasound of biopsied kidney to ensure no immediate complications have developed (i.e. hematoma, hydronephrosis, AV fistula).
18. Apply dressing to biopsy site and turn participant over. Optional: gel foam embolization of the site per operator skill and institutional protocol; Return participant to recovery for monitoring post procedure.


### 7.1.4. Operative Techniques for CT-guided biopsy 
1. Place participant on the CT procedure table in the prone position.
- If the participant is unable to tolerate laying in the prone position the procedure can be performed in either decubitus position. The dependent kidney should be targeted to minimize motion from respiration.
2. The participant should be able to follow simple breathing commands when instructed.
3. Blood pressure and pulse should be monitored during the procedure; if your center routinely monitors pulse oxygenation this should be monitored throughout the procedure.
4. Place a radiopaque grid over each kidney.
- Review of prior CT scans may help identify the optimal kidney for biopsy.
5. Perform a preliminary CT scan of the kidneys. (Follow department CT parameters for kVp and mAs for CT abdomen).
- Obtain a preliminary scan in a phase of respiration the participant can easily replicate.
6. Choose the most accessible kidney and mark a skin entry site overlying the lower pole focusing on the periphery of the kidney. (The participant needs to hold their breath in the same manner as the preliminary CT scan at the time of marking).
7. Remove the radiopaque grid. Sterilize the area.
8. Using sterile precautions (gown, gloves, mask, hairnet), ensure the area surrounding the biopsy site has sterile drapes so the biopsy can be performed using sterile technique.
9. Apply local anesthetic (lidocaine or other) to the skin followed by a deeper application in the subcutaneous tissue. Additionally, conscious sedation may be used at this point to ensure participant comfort during the procedure. (Caution with sedation should be taken to not affect the participant’s ability to follow breathing commands).
10. Optional: After local anesthesia has been achieved, use a scalpel to make a small incision in the skin at the marked spot.
11. Using intermittent helical scans (3 mm slices) or CT-fluoroscopy (3 mm slices), advance the introducer needle from a coaxial biopsy set to the desired target (peripheral tissue of the inferior pole). During each advancement of the needle the participant should be performing the same breath-hold.
12. Once the introducer needle is placed a few millimeters within the renal tissue, proceed to obtain a core sample. (The participant should be performing a breath-hold immediately before deploying the biopsy needle. After the biopsy needle is deployed the participant can breathe normally.) 
13. Remove the biopsy needle and carefully submit the sample.
14. Perform a focused helical CT or CT-fluoroscopic scan to assess for hemorrhage.
- If hemorrhage is present, it is at the operator’s discretion to continue or abort the procedure.
15. Repeat steps 12-14 for additional samples.
16. (Optional): Biopsy tract embolization with gel foam, autologous clot or other, injected though the introducer needle, is at the operator’s discretion or institutional protocol.
17. Remove the introducer needle and apply manual pressure to the biopsy site until bleeding stops from the surface needle insertion site (~5 minutes). Apply a sterile dressing to the site.
18. Perform a final helical CT scan of the target kidney to assess for hemorrhage or stability of a hematoma.
19. If a hematoma is present, consider a repeat CT scan in 5 or 10 minutes to document stability or growth.
20. Turn the participant over onto their recovery bed and return to recovery for monitoring post-procedure.


### 7.1.5. Post-Procedure 
1. Participants are kept at bed rest for at least 4 hours. They are monitored and vital signs recorded.
2. Vital signs are monitored every 15 minutes for an hour, every 30 minutes for an hour, and then hourly. Only the vitals (pulse and blood pressure) at the four-hour mark post-biopsy need to be recorded in REDCap. Pain level is assessed immediately and 4 hours after the procedure.
3. Participants void their bladder at least once post-procedure to verify no obstruction from clot. A bedside commode is permitted, as appropriate after 2 hours of bed rest if initial urine is clear of gross blood.
4. If there is gross blood in the urine, participants remain at bed rest until urine is clear.
5. Participants are observed for 4 hours in the post-procedure recovery area at the participating site. At the end of 4 hours, hemoglobin is measured. If participants are stable, they continue to maintain bedrest with bathroom privileges to complete the period of observation.
6. If participant is deemed unstable by the biopsy operator, they are admitted to the observation unit or inpatient service consistent with their condition and as assessed by the operating clinician, and care is provided as clinically appropriate.
7. Stability is defined by appropriate clinical and laboratory metrics including vital signs, symptoms such as flank pain, gross hematuria or other evidence of post-biopsy bleeding such as abdominal tenderness on the side of the biopsy. A fall in hemoglobin of more than 2 grams/dL or more than 1 gram/dL to less than 9 grams/dL requires extended observation, with follow-up measurement of hemoglobin after an interval of at least 2 hours. Additional observation, including overnight observation or hospital admission, will be done if clinically indicated.
a. Note that an Adverse Event should be reported for a hemoglobin drop of more than 1 gram/dL.
8. If hematuria, falling hematocrit, or local pain suggests a hematoma, the period of bed rest is extended, and the hematoma size is monitored by serial ultrasonography of the kidney.
9. If bleeding fails to stop or the circulation is compromised by the size of the hemorrhage, a surgeon and an interventional radiologist (if necessary) are consulted regarding possible embolization of the bleeding vessel or surgical intervention.
10. If admitted, participants must have a stable hemoglobin status and hemodynamics (less than 1g/dL drop) prior to discharge.
11. When participants are stable to go home, either after 6 hours of observation or after an inpatient stay, they are instructed to avoid heavy physical activities for a week. Warfarin can be resumed the evening of the biopsy if no active bleeding. Aspirin and other anti-coagulation medications can be resumed 24-48 hours after the procedure if no active bleeding.


## 7.2. Procedure for Open Biopsy 
### 7.2.1. Operator 
Open surgical biopsies will be performed by the surgeon performing the primary open abdominal surgery. Only surgeons who are privileged to perform open surgical procedures by the bylaws of the site and are registered and approved by KPMP will perform the procedure. The site PI should verify the credentials of the operators at that site.


All KPMP-certified biopsy operators should 
4. Ensure their medical staff bylaws allow their participation in research as a key provider 
5. Be covered by hospital/institution insurance 


### 7.2.2. Operative Techniques 
In general, deference is given to the operative attending surgeon regarding the conduct of the procedure, based on their clinical judgment to safely acquire the intended specimens. As such, the following technique is deliberately flexible to permit the surgeon appropriate latitude within specified limits.
1. The determination of whether or not to proceed with the research biopsy will be at the sole discretion of the operative attending surgeon who will quantify and qualify the risks and benefits of the procedure based on their clinical experience and the study’s informed consent document.
2. At a time and interval appropriate to conduct the research biopsy, expose the right or left kidney, whichever is easiest. The determination of which kidney to biopsy with be at the discretion of the operative attending surgeon.
3. Incise Gerota’s fascia transversely over the inferior pole to the level of the renal capsule.
4. Using a 16-gauge[4] core needle, obtain 3 cores with a maximum of 5 passes.
- Orient the tract of the biopsy to avoid the renal calyx and any observable cysts.
- Orient the tract to obtain both cortex and medulla.
- Insert the needle to a depth sufficient to obtain a minimum length biopsy ≥ 1.4 cm.
5. Place and wrap each core in a normal (0.9%) saline-soaked TELFA gauze and in a biopsy container.
6. Obtain hemostasis at the renal capsule (in step-wise fashion):
- Electrocautery, Aquamantis, or another suitable coagulator.
- Fibrin glue injection into the biopsy site, using an 18- or 20-gauge angiocatheter.
- Gel-foam pledgeted tamponade buttress placed, using 3-0 monofilament, absorbable suture with tapered needle.
7. Close Gerota’s fascia with 2-0 polygalactone suture in running layer.


### 7.2.3. Post-Operative Monitoring 
1. Hemoglobin concentration is serially measured for all participants at 4 hours and 8 hours post biopsy and then daily. A fall in hemoglobin of >2 grams/dL - OR - >1 gram/dL to less than 9 grams/dL requires a repeat measurement if attributable to bleeding from the biopsy site 
2. In the event that significant bleeding (>2g/L drop in Hgb from baseline concentration) is identified, an ultrasound or non-contrast CT is obtained emergently, with the choice of imaging procedure at the discretion of the primary surgical service or critical care services.
3. If imaging shows perinephric fluid consistent with a hematoma, the biopsied kidney is further investigated with a repeat imaging within 12-24 hours. Hemoglobin concentrations are serially measured every six hours until stable.
4. The following circumstances prompt interventional radiology consultation for angioembolization.
- Volumetric enlargement of hematoma >25% from baseline measurement.
- A drop in Hgb more than 2g/dL in a 24-hour interval attributable to bleeding from the biopsy site.
- Any hemodynamic instability (SPB less than 90, or at the discretion of the primary surgical or critical care services) considered to be due to bleeding from biopsy site.
5. After IR angioembolization, all safety measures are repeated.


## 7.3. QC 
Assessment of biopsy complication rates to suspend biopsies and trigger DSMB review KPMP is closely monitoring the biopsy complication rates at each recruitment site and study-wide. The SAC and DSMB have set a priori thresholds for rates; if exceeded, biopsies at the recruitment site will be paused to enable review of the contributing factors. Biopsies will be resumed upon determination of adequate safety precautions being followed by the site.


To assess these occurrences, more than 10 participants are needed for bleeding, nephrectomy and death, or 20 for angiography. If less than 10 participants are enrolled at the site, occurrence of any SAE in one participant will result in a temporary suspension of biopsies, pending review by the SAC.


After an individual Recruitment Site surpasses ten biopsies, the relevant biopsy complication rates are:
For CKD 
- Occurrence of bleeding requiring transfusion in ≥ 5% of participants.

- Occurrence of bleeding requiring angiographic intervention in ≥ 2.5% of participants.

- Occurrence of bleeding requiring nephrectomy in any participant.

- Occurrence of death directly related to biopsy in any participant.


AKI 
- Occurrence of bleeding requiring transfusion in ≥ 10% of participants.

- Occurrence of bleeding requiring angiographic intervention in ≥ 5% of participants.

- Occurrence of bleeding requiring nephrectomy in any participant.

- Occurrence of death directly related to biopsy in any participant.


Study-wide Recruitment Site biopsy complication rates:
CKD 
- Occurrence of bleeding requiring transfusion in ≥ 7 % of participants.

- Occurrence of bleeding requiring angiographic intervention in ≥ 3% of participants.

- Occurrence of bleeding requiring nephrectomy in ≥ 2% of participants.

- Occurrence of death directly related to biopsy in ≥1 % of participants.


AKI 
- Occurrence of bleeding requiring transfusion in ≥ 10 % of participants.

- Occurrence of bleeding requiring angiographic intervention in ≥ 5 % of participants.

- Occurrence of bleeding requiring nephrectomy in ≥ 3% of participants.

- Occurrence of death directly related to biopsy in ≥1 % of participants.


# 8. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 
Kidney biopsies have known risks (See table 7). The KPMP protocol is designed to minimize these risks.
Nonetheless, the KPMP will closely monitor adverse events (AEs) related to kidney biopsies and other procedures in order to detect AEs and identify whether known potential AEs are occurring at unexpected rates. The KPMP will organize regular, systematic review of these AEs and alter protocols as needed to maximize safety for current and future participants.
AEs will be collected through three methods:


1. The presence or absence of known potential AEs of kidney biopsies will be prospectively surveyed by Research Coordinators or other study staff at the time of kidney biopsy and 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 28 days after kidney biopsy using standard case report forms.


2. Participants will be asked to report pain and related AEs using a standardized questionnaire 28 days after kidney biopsy.


3. Site investigators will report any AEs potentially related to KPMP procedures using standard case report forms in the PMP.
All AEs will be classified in terms of severity and relation to KPMP activities as well as whether they constitute a serious AE (SAE). AEs identified from any source will be reviewed by the KPMP Safety and Adjudication Committee (SAC). All AEs will be collated and reported regularly to the Steering Committee, IRB, DSMB, and NIDDK. SAEs will be reported individually within specified time intervals.


## 8.1. Adverse Events related to KPMP Biopsy Procedure 
Recruitment sites will report all deaths occurring within 28 days of a KPMP biopsy, all serious adverse events occurring within 28 days of a KPMP biopsy, and adverse events occurring within 28 days of a KPMP biopsy that are determined by site personnel to be possibly or definitely related to the biopsy procedure. The timeline for reporting is detailed in Table 8.


All deaths and unanticipated non-fatal adverse events involving risks to participants or others that occur within 28 days of a KPMP biopsy will be reported to the Clinical Data Coordinating Center, DSMB, NIDDK, and IRB on an expedited basis. This will include both serious and non-serious adverse events that are assessed by the local site investigator and/or the CDCC to be (a) an untoward event that is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency with respect to the KPMP kidney biopsy and related procedures and the characteristics of the CKD/AKI population being studied; and (b) definitely or possibly related to the KPMP kidney biopsy and related procedures.


Anticipated non-fatal adverse events will be promptly reported to the CDCC, DSMB, and NIDDK. These events will only be reported in aggregate to the IRB and SAC, in accordance with the timeline shown in Table 8.


The study will systematically collect all serious adverse events, regardless of whether they are possibly or definitely related to the biopsy procedure, and will report these promptly to the DSMB, NIDDK, and IRB. The study will not systematically collect unrelated, non-serious adverse events.


The rationale for this approach is that adverse events that are unanticipated may change assessment of the risks and safety of the KPMP biopsy procedure and may therefore require prompt revision of study procedures and documents, including the informed consent form. In contradistinction, individual adverse events that are considered anticipated complications associated with the KPMP biopsy procedure or with the population of participants being studied cannot be meaningfully interpreted as individual events but need to be evaluated in aggregate to assess overall rates and trends within the study and at individual study sites.


Each site’s Principal Investigator and their research team (co-Investigators, research nurses, clinical coordinators, and data managers) are responsible for identifying adverse events and determining if the event is anticipated or unanticipated as a complication of the KPMP biopsy or the nature of the CKD/AKI populations being recruited. A list of anticipated biopsy-related adverse events is provided in Table 7.


Pain in the area of biopsy needle insertion and a feeling of internal discomfort on the side of the biopsy are common but generally mild complications that require only modest analgesia. These symptoms may occur only after the local anesthetic has worn off and will be assessed on a follow-up call or prior to discharge from observation the day after the procedure. Pain and discomfort should resolve within a few days of the biopsy.


A small number of participants may have macroscopic hematuria, which usually occurs shortly following the biopsy. Subcapsular and perinephric hematomas are common, may be asymptomatic, but should be readily identified by the post-procedure kidney ultrasound, and usually do not require intervention.
Some complications like soft tissue infection, arteriovenous fistula, and perhaps adjacent organ puncture may not be apparent at the time of biopsy or shortly thereafter but may develop over time.


For any participant who develops late complications, assessment must be performed to determine relatedness to the KPMP biopsy; and if related, whether it constitutes an unanticipated event.


## 8.2. Prospective surveillance of adverse events by the study team At the time of kidney biopsy, 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 28 days after kidney biopsy, Research Coordinators or other study staff will prospectively survey known potential AEs of kidney biopsies. 
The adverse events that will be assessed are shown in Table 7. Information will be recorded in the Adverse Events CRF.

### Table 7. Anticipated Kidney Biopsy-related Adverse Events Complication Data collected Type of Event Death Timing relative to biopsy, cause, autopsy SAE Soft tissue infection Antibiotics required and duration.

- Wheezing 
- Pneumonia 

## 8.3. Prospective surveillance for participant-reported adverse events 
Each participant will be called to inquire about potential AEs 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 28 days after the kidney biopsy. In addition, a Participant Experience Survey will be collected at 28 days, 6 months, and then annually starting at 18 months after the biopsy. The questionnaire assesses pain and anxiety during and after the kidney biopsy as well as any impact on function and attitudes.


## 8.4. Non-serious adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) that do not meet the definition for an SAE will be considered to be non-serious AEs. Only non-serious AEs that occur within 28 days of a participant undergoing a KPMP biopsy and which are determined by site personnel to be possibly or definitely related to the biopsy procedure will be systematically reported. If a non-serious AE occurs in a hospitalized participant and it cannot be determined if it is due to a KPMP kidney biopsy or the participant’s underlying condition, it should be reported.


## 8.5. Serious adverse events (SAE) 
A serious adverse event (SAE) will be defined as any undesirable experience meeting one or more of the following criteria:


1. Death: all deaths within 28 days from the time of kidney biopsy regardless of relatedness to study participation will be reported to the DSMB.
2. New hospitalization: all new hospitalizations that occur that occur within 28 days from the time of kidney biopsy will be reported as SAEs.
3. Prolonged hospitalization: if a KPMP kidney biopsy is done in a hospitalized participant and the hospitalization is prolonged due to an adverse event occurring within, this will be reported as an SAE.
4. Any life‐threatening event that that occurs within 28 days of the kidney biopsy will be reported as an SAE.
5. Any other event occurring within 28 days of the kidney biopsy that results in persistent, significant, or permanent harm or disability will be reported as an SAE All SAEs of any etiology that occur within 28 days of a participant undergoing a KPMP biopsy should be reported to the DSMB. Reporting timelines and responsibilities are listed in Table 8. Reporting to the Washington University single IRB will be consistent with current single IRB policies.


## 8.6. Timeline for reporting adverse events 
AEs will be reported to the CDCC, KPMP Safety and Adjudication Committee, IRB, DSMB, and NIDDK according to the following guidelines:

### Table 8. Reporting Timelines and Responsibilities 
Event Reporting to CDCC Reporting to SAC Reporting to IRB Reporting to DSMB and NIDDK Death 1 business day 1 business day 2 business days 1 business day Unanticipated non-fatal AEa,b 3 business days 1 week 10 business days 3 business days Anticipated non-fatal AEa,c 3 business days Weekly summary Continuing Review 3 business days Unrelated non-fatal AEa,d 3 business days weekly summary Continuing Review 3 business days aAll non-fatal SAEs regardless of relatedness and all non-serious AEs that are determined by site personnel to be possibly or definitely related and that occur within 28 days of the KPMP kidney biopsy will be systematically reported. Non-serious AEs in hospitalized participants whose relatedness to the KPMP kidney biopsy cannot be determined will be reported as possibly related.
bAn unanticipated AE is defined by the KPMP IRB as an untoward event that is 1) unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency with respect to the KPMP kidney biopsy and related procedures (see Table 7) and the characteristics of the CKD/AKI population being studied; and 2) is definitely or possibly related to the KPMP kidney biopsy and related procedures.
cAn anticipated AE is an untoward event that is 1) definitely or possibly related to the KPMP kidney biopsy and related procedures; and 2) is expected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency with respect to the KPMP kidney biopsy and related procedures (see table 7) or the characteristics of the CKD/AKI population being studied.
dNon-serious AEs that are determined by site personnel to be unrelated to the biopsy procedure will not be systematically reported, but if reported to the CDCC will be included in aggregate reports to the SAC, IRB, DSMB and NIDDK.


## 8.7. KPMP Safety and Adjudication Committee 
The KPMP Safety and Adjudication Committee will review all AEs reported by KPMP sites. Fatal events will be reviewed by the Committee or a portion of the Committee within 24 hours of reporting, and non-fatal SAEs will be reviewed within 3 business days of reporting. The committee will be charged with making a determination (adjudicating) whether each SAE is an anticipated or unanticipated adverse event. Non-serious AEs will be reviewed regularly, i.e. monthly. The Committee will regularly review the cumulative frequency of observed AEs (collated by the CDCC) to identify any AEs that are unanticipated or occurring at higher than expected frequencies. The Committee will report their findings regularly to the KPMP Steering Committee and make recommendations to the Steering Committee regarding any changes that should be made to the KPMP protocol to mitigate AEs. Determinations of the Safety and Adjudication Committee will also be made available as requested to the IRB, DSMB, and NIDDK in order to help assess the safety of KPMP activities. All deaths and serious adverse events (regardless of relation to biopsy) occurring within 28 days of a KPMP biopsy will be immediately reported to the DSMB upon entry into the PMP.


## 8.8. Adverse Event Reporting Procedures 
Adverse events are reported in REDCap in the “KPMP Adverse Event Reporting” project. Noting an AE as “resolved” in the REDCap CRF does not require that all symptoms be 100% resolved. In the CRF, an AE disposition of “resolved” means that no further follow-up is needed for the safety of the participant, and that the study investigator feels that the case is settled. If the Safety & Adjudication Committee agrees, the AE is resolved. If the SAC disagrees, the AE is left open with continued monitoring.
Adverse event reporting procedures and timelines are displayed visually in figure 4.


### Figure 4. Adverse event reporting procedures and timelines 

### 8.8.1. Fatal Event (occurring within 28 days of the biopsy) 
All deaths in this time frame need to be reported in REDCap and confirmed by RS PI within 1 day of knowledge of the event. Deaths that occur more than 28-days after biopsy are not reviewed by the SAC.

  - If the death appears related or possibly related to KPMP participation, ALSO report it in myIRB, using the Reportable Event Form. This form also needs to be submitted within 1 day of knowledge of the event.

  
Did a KPMP participant pass away within 28 days of the biopsy?
 Yes? Report right away in REDCap (within 1 day) Was the death possibly or definitely related to KPMP participation?
 Yes? Also report right away in myIRB (within 1 day) 

8.8.2. Non-Fatal Event (occurring within 28 days of the biopsy) Any adverse event in this time frame that appears related or possibly related to KPMP participation needs to be reported in REDCap and approved by the RS PI within 3 days of knowledge of the event.

  - Any adverse event in this time frame that appears related or possibly related to KPMP participation and is unanticipated ALSO needs to be reported in myIRB, using the Reportable Event Form. Submit this form within 10 days of knowledge of the event.
Any adverse event in this time frame that appears unrelated to KPMP participation but is nonetheless Serious needs to be reported in REDCap and approved by the RS PI within 3 days of knowledge of the event.
Does the AE seem related to the biopsy?

- Yes? Report in REDCap (within 3 days) 
- No? Is it a Serious AE? If Yes, Report in REDCap (within 3 days) Does the AE qualify as an Unanticipated Problem?

- Yes? Also report in myIRB (within 10 days) 

8.8.3. Unanticipated Problems (IRB definition):
IRB defined Unanticipated Problems as unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; Are related or possibly related to participation in the research; and suggest that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.


9. Laboratory 

9.1. Collection, Processing and Shipping of Samples Recruitment Sites will collect blood, DNA, stool and urine samples from study participants at baseline and follow-up visits. Sample type, volume, processing, and priority at visits are described in the Biospecimen MOP.


10. Biopsy Adjudication Process 

10.1. AKI Adjudication Subcommittee When an AKI patient is enrolled, the Central Hub will contact the Recruitment Site PI to schedule two adjudication calls within 72 hours and 3-5 days after biopsy. Multiple cases may be presented on the same call, and reviewers for first and second adjudication calls are not required to be the same. A minimum of 5 committee members are needed for the call, not including representatives of the presenting Recruitment Site. If AKI Adjudication Subcommittee Chairs cannot be on the call, the Central Hub will appoint a chair to lead the call.
The Recruitment Site PI or designee (e.g. a co-I who enrolled the patient) develops a brief summary to discuss on the call and should also have access to the patient’s chart during the call to answer any questions that come up. Summary should include medical history, lab work, date of AKI onset, physical exam, duration of elevated creatinine and likely etiology. Summary information will not be distributed prior to the adjudication phone call. Adjudicators will ask questions and then a collective decision will be made regarding the clinical diagnosis and disease course. If there is not a unanimous decision a vote may be taken.
The Site PI or Research Coordinator enter the final adjudication information into the 24-72 hour and 3-5 day AKI Adjudication CRFs in the REDCap data collection program after each call.


10.2. CKD Adjudication Subcommittee After CKD pathology slides are uploaded into the DVC Whole Slide Image Viewer, DCC contacts CKD PI and Pathologist to schedule case presentation. Recruitment Site PI or designee (e.g. a co-I who enrolled the participant) presents a clinical vignette (omitting the pathology results) and answers reviewer questions (consulting the EHR if necessary). Committee members ask questions and adjudicate an agreed upon diagnosis based on the provided information. If there is not a unanimous decision a vote may be taken.
The RS Pathologist reviews biopsy slides (using the DVC Whole Slide Image Viewer when possible) and reads the diagnosis recorded in the pathology report. The Committee then re-adjudicates the final diagnosis based on clinical information and pathology review.
After the call, the presenting PI completes the CKD Adjudication CRF in the KPMP REDCap program, describing the clinical case and summarizing the collective thoughts of the group.


11. Data Management System User Guide 

11.1. Accessing KPMP Data Management System (DMS) Tools Initial access to KPMP DMS Tools will be granted after completion of the KPMP user intake form. A link to the intake form will be on the main KPMP application login page.

- The intake survey collects institution, role, email and other contact information. Users are required to enter an email address; they are encouraged to enter the email from their KPMP member institution.

- KPMP central hub personnel will review the survey response. Access to applications will be controlled by which study role (Researcher, Provider or Participant) is entered in the survey.

- Each site will have a primary KPMP contact who will be contacted to confirm access for those researchers belonging to their site. For those researchers not belonging to a KPMP study site, a reference will be asked for in the survey. Participants and providers do not need to go through this process.

- Most institutional logins from KPMP study sites will serve as a person’s login to KPMP applications. A login account will be provided for those who do not have a compatible institutional login account.

- REDCap will be set up to send out an email with a survey link yearly for people (and their site contact or reference) to fill out to keep their access to KPMP applications. Once a renewal survey is filled out, study personnel will review the survey and update the renewal and expiration dates for that person. People who do not respond to the survey would not retain access to the applications.
After completion of the intake process a user will access applications by logging in through the KPMP application menu found at kpmp.org.


11.2. Data Collection Tablet Best Practices All data collection applications used within the KPMP will be web-based with password protection.
Access to these applications will not be restricted to KPMP-provided tablets.
Instructions for KPMP-provided tablet handling can be found in Appendix E “iPad Tablet User Guide"
.
The central hub may provide study iPad tablets for use by the Recruitment Sites if needed. However, all data collection applications used by KPMP will be web based and data entry will not be limited to iPad devices. If a site has iPads or other computers/tablets they will be able to use those.
Security best practices for all devices used for KPMP data access including tablets:

- Password protection should be enabled, and devices should be locked when not in use.

- All KPMP applications and other programs containing participant information should be closed and logged out of when not in use.

- Never share personal passwords between employees.

- Ensure all computers have updated anti-virus software installed.

- Software updates to the operating system and applications should be completed promptly when available 

11.3. Participant Registration Tools For the most detailed and current instructions on the use of REDCap, see the Training Resources on Basecamp.


11.3.1. KPMP Electronic Data Capture System (REDCap) After logging into the KPMP REDCap instance (redcap.kpmp.org) you are taken to the REDCap Home Page. On the top navigation menu choose My Projects.
From the My Projects screen choose KPMP Participant Management When the homepage for the KPMP Participant Management comes up, you can add a new participant record or edit an existing record find the ‘Add / Edit Records’ link in the left navigation panel.


11.3.2. Potential Participant Registration Module To register a potential new participant in the KPMP REDCap instance, select the ‘Add /Edit Records’
button and on the following page select the ‘Add new record’ button. This will take you to a new study record page:
Click the radio button for one of the initial ‘Screening’ participant CRFs, complete the required information and save to register the potential participant to the study.


11.3.3. Assigning Participant ID On completion of the initial CRF, a unique sequential 5-digit (NNNNN) Study ID will be assigned by the KPMP REDCap system. KPMP participant IDs will be unique across all study sites and will contain no identifying information.


11.3.4. Registering Participants to KPMP To register a participant as enrolled in KPMP within the DMS complete all CRFs listed in the Screening section to indicate that the participant has met all requirements for enrollment to the study.
On successful completion of these CRFs according to study protocol the participant record status will change to enrolled and additional CRFs for post enrollment data will be available in the participant study record.


11.4. Kit and Supply Requests For the most detailed and current instructions on the use of Inventory Management, see the Training Resources on Basecamp.
Biopsy/Specimen kit requests should be entered in the REDCap KPMP Inventory Request form, which triggers notification to the CBR. Kit requests should be completed with appropriate lead time (ideally, two weeks) so new kits arrive before stock is depleted. A link to the KPMP Inventory Request form can be found in the left nav of the KPMP REDCap project:


11.5. Specimen Tracking For the most detailed and current instructions on the use of SpecTrack, see the Training Resources on Basecamp.
The KPMP Specimen Tracking system (SpecTrack) (specimen.kpmp.org) will be used to track the movement, derivative creation, processing and status of all participant specimens collected within the KPMP study. Specimen types which will be tracked include: Biopsy, Blood, Urine and Stool.
The initial record indicating a participant specimen was collected will be recorded in the appropriate participant CRF in REDCap. The samples will be labeled with unique study barcodes from the provided participant specimen kit. These samples will then be available for tracking in the SpecTrack system.


11.5.1. Outbound Specimen Shipment All outbound specimen shipments should be recorded promptly in SpecTrack so that the destination site is notified of the inbound shipment and prepared for receipt. To record a specimen shipment, access SpecTrack at (specimen.kpmp.org). The shipments pane provides information about current inbound and outbound shipments for your site and provides two options for generating a new shipment, either by selecting samples from a list or typing/scanning sample identifiers.
Outbound shipments are typically entered in two steps:


1. Define shipment contents, destination site and upload images a. Choose one of the methods listed on the shipping tab to select items for shipment, these include selecting samples from a list of available samples at your site or typing/barcode scanning sample identifiers.
b. Select the destination site. The shipping address will be populated by the specimen tracking system but should be verified.
c. Record any shipment images collected for QA purposes 

2. Record shipper and tracking ID a. Shipper and tracking ID can be provided when initially recording the shipment information or can be left blank until known.
b. To add the shipper and tracking ID at a later time, find the shipment record on the ‘Shipments’ tab using the shipment search box or in the outbound shipment list and select the ‘Update’ link.
c. Once the shipper and tracking ID have been provided email message will be dispatched to contacts at the destination site. This email message includes shipment contents, notes and tracking information.


11.5.2. Specimen Shipment Receipt Inbound specimen shipment receipt should be recorded promptly in the specimen tracking system so that any data quality or content issues can be quickly resolved. To record a specimen shipment receipt, access the specimen tracking system at (specimen.kpmp.org). Locate the shipment by searching by shipment or tracking ID or by finding the shipment record in the inbound shipment list.
Review the shipment contents carefully and record the status, temperature and any local non-KPMP identifier applied to the shipment samples on receipt.
If shipment contents discrepancies are found or if samples are damaged in shipment, the shipping site should be notified promptly and take steps to resolve it.


11.5.3. Specimen Derivatives and Processing All derivative creation and sample processing that occurs after initial specimen collection should be recorded in SpecTrack.
To record derivative creation for a sample at your site access SpecTrack at (specimen.kpmp.org) and select the ’Samples’ tab. Find the sample in the list of samples on site or search by sample ID and select the ‘add derivatives’ action.
Record when the derivatives were created and the sample type of the new derivatives. If creation of the derivatives was terminal for the parent sample, indicate that as well so we can track that the parent sample is no longer valid.
Sample processing, such as slide staining can be recorded in a similar fashion. Find the sample as above then select the sample processed action:
Record the time the processing occurred and any changes to the human readable identifier.


11.5.4. Sample Labeling and Barcoding All KPMP samples will be labeled with a KPMP specific label. This label will include both a barcode and a human readable identifier. Both the REDCap application and the Specimen Tracking system will support the scanning of sample identifiers for entry of data related to those samples. Labels for the initial collection of participant samples will be provided in kits to the Recruitment Site. The barcode on these labels will include an immutable identifier that will not change, this will allow the human readable identifier to change when needed while maintaining a robust link between the participant record and all samples related to the participant.


11.5.5. Data Quality Management Procedures Several standardization procedures will be employed to ensure high quality data in this study. Standard protocols and training manuals are provided. Site personnel are trained in the data collection system.
Data collection software will be programmed with range, logic, and missing data checks.
Additional logic and cross-form data checks will be implemented as data quality rules. When a data quality discrepancy is encountered a data query can be issued to the data collection site. The data can then be corrected or resolved as verified 

11.6. Resolving Data Quality Discrepancies For the most detailed and current instructions on the use of REDCap Data Quality Rules, see the Training Resources on Basecamp.
REDCap has a feature to run data quality rules to check for discrepancies in the collected data. These data quality rules should be run and resolved at the conclusion of each study visit. Research Coordinators should check the “Resolve Issues” link 1-2 times per week to address any queries sent from the CDCC. To get started, within the REDCap PMP, click on Data Quality from the left menu under "Applications".
It will open the Data Quality Module:


1. Under the "Apply to:" dropdown, choose a participant.


2. Click on "Execute" for the following rules:
B: Missing values* (required fields only) D: Field validation errors (out of range) 

3. Click on "All Custom", which will run the rules 1, 2, 3, ...


4. For all discrepancies (highlighted in pink/red) click on the "view" link.
This will show the list of discrepancies. The values involved in the data quality rule will be shown.


5. Click on the link to the value 

6. The CRF will open. Enter the data or change the data as appropriate.


7. If it is not appropriate to change the data, then enter a comment 

8. This will open the Data Resolution Workflow 

8.1. Verified data value means that the data is correct and should not be changed, despite triggering a discrepancy.


8.2. Open query allows you to comment on the value, and optionally assign the query to a user. This could possibly lead to a back-and-forth discussion about the value.


9. Creating data queries (data resolution workflow) directly from the data entry form 

9.1. From the data entry form, you can click on this button next to any field to open a data query about that field.


10. Responding to Data Queries Click on "Resolve Issues" to view the Data Resolution Dashboard This page displays all data queries that are currently unresolved or have already been resolved using the Data Resolution Workflow. Some issues may have been initiated by users on data collection instruments, and others may have been initiated after executing Data Quality rules on the Find Issues tab. The table lists the name of the record and the specific field or Data Quality rule to which the data query belongs, as well as the user assigned to the query (if applicable), the number of days the data query has been open, and a brief snippet of the query's first and last comment. The results in the table can be filtered by the query status type (e.g., open, closed), by certain fields or Data Quality rules, and also by users assigned to it. Each data query may be viewed by clicking the button to its left.


11. Using the Resolve Issues Page 

12. Reporting of Results 

12.1. Reporting Biopsy Results to Participants and Health Care Providers KPMP investigators and coordinators recognize the importance of sharing information with participants and their health care providers. Return of results with the appropriate clinical interpretation in language the participant will comprehend is an important goal of the study and essential to build and maintain trust among KPMP participants and investigators. Return of results will first be discussed during the informed consent process, when participants will be given clear details about what results will be provided, and how and when results will be made available. Participants need to understand the utility of the results and what information the results can or cannot provide. Participant expectations for returning results should be addressed during the informed consent process to aid in their decision about whether to participate in the study. Participants should update their contact information if there are any changes on who should receive results (i.e. change of primary care provider).
Baseline study results will include CLIA-certified clinical biopsy results generated by the site pathologist and eGFR measures. These results will be included in the participant’s electronic medical record.
The primary report will be available within a few weeks after the KPMP Biopsy Visit and will include CLIA-certified results of the clinical biopsy and eGFR (based on serum creatinine). A KPMP investigator or the participant’s primary kidney doctor will interpret the local pathology report and explain its contents using plain language (through a language interpreter, if necessary) appropriate to the participant’s level of understanding. This report will be shared at the convenience of the participant. Participants can specify how they would like to receive their study results in the Contact CRF, where research coordinators record whether the participant would like to receive results by phone, mail, or at an in-person visit. With their initial printed results, participants will receive a template cover letter thanking them for their participation and describing the content of the biopsy report. Because participants can choose for their primary (non-KPMP) kidney doctor to explain the biopsy report contents, the template letter will be an important communication tool from the KPMP investigator to the KPMP participant.
KPMP cases where biopsy tissue was obtained will undergo diagnostic review by the clinical adjudication committee. In case any novel diagnostic findings are revealed during this process, such findings will be related back to the primary clinical pathologist, providing opportunities for the primary pathology report to be amended. The new finding or diagnosis will then be discussed with the participant by their PCP, nephrologist and/or KPMP investigator.
During the course of the KPMP study visits and assessments, the study physician may learn something about the participant that has significant health implications but may not be related to KPMP study participation or the kidney biopsy. In these circumstances, the study physician will alert the physician primarily responsible for the participant’s care so that appropriate evaluation can be done. The KPMP investigators will facilitate referral to an independent nephrologist, or relevant sub-specialist, but will not themselves provide care to participants to avoid conflict-of-interest or the appearance of conflict-of-interest. RS physicians are welcome write up a brief summary of the specific findings to add to the Cover letter and Full report when providing biopsy results to patients. This summary does not need IRB approval prior to providing it to the participant.


12.2. Reporting Genetics and “omics” Results to Participants and Health Care Providers Participants in KPMP are likely to undergo whole exome and/or whole genome sequencing, although the timing of this is currently uncertain. For those participants who agree to the receipt of individual results from genetic analyses, any medically actionable findings (as defined by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics or ACMG) may be communicated to the participant, as well as the physician chosen by the participant (as state laws allow). Additionally, participants may have the option of having information about risk alleles related to kidney function (for example risk variants of the APO-L1 gene, if assay is performed in a CLIA-certified lab) returned even if not known to be medically actionable. A process within the KPMP will guide decisions of how and when to return genomic results to participants including common language explanations. This process will include a designated panel of KPMP stakeholders, experts, and patient partners for KPMP guidance and oversight. When such results may become available in the course of KPMP research is indeterminate. The KPMP return of results process will include periodic re-evaluation of risks and benefits associated with return of results from KPMP and from knowledge gained in other similar studies and as updated by the ACMG.
In KPMP there will be additional results obtained from non-diagnostic, research-only “omics” tests run on the kidney biopsy tissue. However, since these research methods often do not have the accuracy of diagnostic tests, we do not currently plan to return these results to participants on an individual level.
However, aggregated, de-identified “omics” datasets will be available for participants to access online.
Given the deep molecular phenotyping of the biospecimens and biopsies, there may be identification of potentially actionable, but currently “silent” incidental findings. Any clinically actionable findings may need to be confirmed by a clinical test performed in a certified diagnostic laboratory. Therefore, if a potentially actionable finding is detected, study staff may recommend an appropriate diagnostic test to confirm the findings if the participant has agreed to receive such information. If necessary, the study staff will facilitate referral to a nephrologist, clinical geneticist, or other relevant sub-specialist, but will not themselves provide care to participants. They and their treating physicians will together decide whether they want to perform such confirmatory test(s). Participants may be given the option to receive these data or indicate that they wish not to be informed of such findings. For those participants who agree to the receipt of individual results, any medically actionable findings will be communicated to the participant, as well as the physician chosen by the participant.


13. Electronic Health Record Data 

13.1. Collection of electronic health record data 
- Individual sites will collect electronic health record data for enrolled participants at regular intervals throughout the project, following the timing described in the clinical protocol.

- Health record data will be collected at each Recruitment Site by the Recruitment Site team and prepared for submission to the Central Hub.

- Recruitment Sites will replace patient identifiers with the participant’s research identifier. None of the HIPAA safe harbor variables or data elements will be included in a submission.

- EHR data will be submitted to the Central Hub in a common data model/format. Currently that format is the OHDSI OMOP standard, and data will be submitted from the sites as a compressed archive containing .csv files.

- The submission will be made through a REDCap form at http://redcap.kpmp.org/ and the Recruitment Site will fill in submission metadata on the form (see Section 11: Data Management System User Guide).

- The Central Hub will incorporate the EHR data into a relational database (EHRdb).

- All extractions of data from the EHRdb will utilize an honest broker, that is, a member of the DCC team that is authorized to prepare data for the purpose it is to be used for, including de-identification.

- Extracted data for use in the Kidney Tissue Atlas and within the DVC will be uploaded into the KPMP Data Lake.


13.2. EHR Data Use Best Practices 
- KPMP EHR data, whether at the site or the Central Hub, will always be stored in an encrypted location with basic HIPAA auditing functions in place. All user access will be tracked.

- Honest brokers will be used whenever possible for the movement of EHR data across systems (such as Recruitment Site to DCC or DCC to KPMP Data Lake) 
- EHR data will be mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model by the Recruitment Sites.


13.3. Preparing EHR data Sites will work with their informatics, Analytics or Research IT teams for data preparation. EHR data will be extracted across the timeframe requested using the institutions’ home policies. It is the responsibility of the site to follow their home institution’s policies and governance regarding data access of protected health information for research.
Data will be mapped to OHDSI OMOP format described here (https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/). The OMOP version to be mapped will be officially stated on the REDCap submission form. OMOP data will likely be managed at each site in a secure, HIPAA-aligned relational database system and then extracted to plain text .CSV files for submission to the Central Hub.
Figure 5. Schema for the OMOP Data Model as described in documentation at http://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation:cdm 

13.4. Submitting EHR data through REDCap Bundles of CSV files for submission to the Central Hub will be zipped archives containing all .CSV files for each submission. Each submission can contain multiple participants. Files will be attached to the REDCap form to be linked on the KPMP intranet website.
The form will be filled out to specify the submitting site, time frame being submitted, a time stamp and the submitting user at the site.


13.5. Submitted file processing The REDCap submitted zip files will be extracted, csv files processed and merged with a DCC local relational EHR database using a script. This database will serve as the system of record for all health record data to be used by the hub and will employ full access auditing and encryption.
Quality control scripts will be applied to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Any data conflicts will be ameliorated between the DCC informatics personnel and the site informatics team.


13.6. Health record data access Raw KPMP health record data will be made through a request to the by emailing the honest broker (to be named by the KPMP DCC PI). De-identified or datasets prepared for dissemination or integration into the Kidney Tissue Atlas will be accessed through a self-service web portal maintained by the KPMP DVC.


14. Personnel Training and Certification 

14.1. Standardization of Clinical Procedures Ongoing studies at the Recruitment Sites will result in data accumulated by study personnel and derived from adhering to multiple procedures in the course of their responsibilities. By standardizing study procedures and requiring that such data-gathering individuals need to demonstrate the required level of procedural knowledge and competency, the opportunity for inconsistent data will be greatly reduced.


14.2. Responsibilities and Qualifications of Coordinators and Data Entry Personnel Personnel are required to successfully demonstrate competency to the satisfaction of an authorized qualified individual following the completion of online and/or in-person training sessions. In the case of personnel turnover during the study, replacement personnel shall complete standard training and certification prior to their participation in KPMP activities.
The Research Coordinator is responsible for all study operations of their respective Recruitment Sites.
The Research Coordinator will share all information related to specific tests and procedures including manuals of operation (MOP), forms, and training materials related to the protocol with study personnel (clinic coordinator, technicians, data entry personnel) as appropriate.


14.3. KPMP Recruitment Site Data Entry and Clinical Operations Training and Certification Consistency in performing protocol-defined procedures and recording study data strengthens the ability to achieve scientifically accurate outcomes. Therefore, it is crucial that research staff are trained and certified in all KPMP procedures. The CDCC designs sessions to train the Recruitment Site staff in skills necessary to collect, record, and process protocol data, such as using the secure KPMP web site, recording data in the PMP, using the Specimen Tracking System, and performing all KPMP procedures.
The CDCC developed protocol training sessions as well as web-based or videoconference training presentations. When there is turnover in the Lead Research Coordinator position at a Recruitment Site, the CDCC will provide protocol and application training for the new Lead Research Coordinator.
Replacement personnel will complete standard training and certification prior to their participation in KPMP clinic activities. Research Coordinator training will be web-based to maximize participation, be cost-effective, and be available to the other sites.


14.4. KPMP Recruitment Sites Data Entry and Clinical Operations Training and Re-Certification If a Research Coordinator leaves KPMP, they are inactivated in the KPMP certification module. If they return within six montha, they will need to review KPMP procedures and have oversight/supervision by the lead Researcher. If a Research Coordinator returns more than six months after leaving the study, they will follow training and certification procedures as defined for new Research Coordinators.


14.5. Human Subjects Protection Training NIH requires that KPMP personnel complete Human Subjects Protection training. The original tutorial, exam, and certification documentation are available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/education-and-outreach/human-research-protection-training/index.htmlClinical staff follow training and certification guidelines their institutions’ Human Subject Protection Office (HSPO) to ensure they meet their institutional requirements.


14.6 Site Visits Each Recruitment Site will have a pre-study initiation site visit to facilitate training and certification and assure compliance with the KPMP protocol.
Components of the site visit will include:

- Meeting with personnel 
- Examining facilities 
- Reviewing administrative organization within the center 
- Evaluating conduct of a practice biopsy and tissue triage procedure 
- Other activities proposed by the CDCC, the NIDDK, and the OSMB After study initiation, on-site reviews of Recruitment Sites may be scheduled on an as-needed basis to:

- Assess the overall performance of the Recruitment Sites, and the conduct of the ongoing protocol training 
- Assess the quality of data collection 
- Provide consultation in identifying and solving problems 
- Transfer effective approaches from one Recruitment Sites to another The site visit team will include representatives from the Central Hub and possibly NIDDK or a member of the OSMB or another Recruitment Site. The CDCC will prepare site visit reports which will include specific recommendations for the center. The report will be sent to the PI and Research Coordinator at the Recruitment Sites where the site visit was performed, NIDDK, and the Chair of the SC. If serious problems are detected, the report will also be sent to the Steering Committee for review. Each Recruitment Site will be site-visited, as necessary, during the project period.

16. Appendix C Physical Measurements 

16.1. Anthropomorphic Measures 

16.1.1. Height 
- Height is measured in conjunction with the weight measurement. It may precede or follow this procedure.

- A wall mounted stadiometer should be used that can be calibrated with a rod.

- Remove any hat, hair bows, or other head gear that would interfere with the top of the stadiometer touching the crown of the head.

- The participant should be in stocking feet or non-slip slippers and stand on a flat surface that is at a right angle to stadiometer. The weight is evenly distributed between both feet, and the arms are hanging by the sides with palms facing the thighs. The heels are together, touching the stadiometer. The feet are spread at a 60-degree angle to each other. Whenever possible, the head, scapula and buttocks should also be touching the stadiometer. The head is erect with eyes focused straight ahead.

- Lower the horizontal board of the stadiometer to the most superior point on the head, compressing the hair. Standing height is measured to the nearest 0.1 cm.

- Repeat measurement. The 2nd measurement should be within 0.5 cm of the first.

- Record the first of the 2 measurements. If the 2nd measurement is not within 0.5 cm of the first measurement, repeat measurement until you obtain two that are within 0.5 cm of each other.
Record the first of these 2 measurements.

- If the participant cannot stand for the height measurement, it may be recorded from a recent clinic visit in the EMR.


16.1.2. Weight A traditional balanced beam scale has been considered a reliable instrument for population measurement. In the past years, they have often been replaced by electronic digital scales, which are easier to operate. Either type of scale should be calibrated regularly by a reliable vendor, or according to clinic protocol. The floor surface on which the scale rests must be hard and should not be carpeted or covered with other soft material.

- Balance the scale so that the indicator is at zero.

- Participant should empty bladder.

- Have the participant remove any heavy external clothing, shoes, belts, or heavy jewelry.

- Measure weight twice, having the participant step off the scale to repeat zero balance between measurements. The second measurement should be within 0.1 kg of the first measurement.
Record the first measurement on the Physical Measurements CRF.

- If the difference between the 2 measurements is greater than 0.1 kg, repeat the measurement until 2 results are within 0.1 kg and record the first of the 2 measurements on the CRF.

- The scale should be calibrated per unit policy. If the scale is moved on a frequent basis, it should be calibrated more often. If it is stationary, the scale should be calibrated yearly by a certified scale calibration vendor.

- If the participant cannot stand for the weight measurement, it may be recorded from a recent clinic visit in the EMR.


16.2. Temperature Measurement Body temperature can be measured according to clinic standard operating procedures. Record the temperature in degrees Celsius in the Physical Measurements CRF and indicate the location of measurement (oral, aural, forehead, arterial line).

- Oral Measurement: taken as a buccal measurement (in the cheek) or sublingual measurement (under the tongue). Ensure participant has not had anything to eat or drink that was very hot or cold prior to the measurement or engaged in strenuous activity, both of which can affect the core body temperature. It is important that the participant keep their mouth closed during the measurement.

- Ear (Aural) Measurement: the tip of the thermometer is simply inserted properly into the ear canal.

- Forehead Measurement: The forehead thermometer is placed at the center of the forehead of the participant and then slowly slide across the forehead towards the top of the ear, maintaining contact with the skin. An infrared sensor detects the highest measured value, while a second sensor measures the ambient temperature. The difference between these two provides the body temperature.

- Arterial Line Measurement: If an arterial line is placed, review the monitor for a current temperature reading 

16.3. Pulse Measurement The pulse is observed by palpation of the radial artery at the wrist. Alternatively, the pulse may be recorded from an automated blood pressure machine.

- The same arm should be used for both pulse and blood pressure measurements. Indicate which arm is used to measure pulse and blood pressure on the Physical Measurements CRF.

- A good stopwatch should be used for the 5-minute waiting period prior to blood pressure measurement, 30 second pulse measurement, and 60 second intervals between blood pressure readings.

- The measurement of pulse is performed only after the participant has been seated quietly, with feet flat on the floor, in an erect but comfortable posture, for at least five minutes.

- The participant should refrain from caffeine, smoking, and exercise at least one-half hour prior to and until completion of blood pressure measurement.

- The elbow and forearm should rest comfortably on the table. With the palm of the hand turned upward, the radial pulse is palpated and counted for 30 seconds exactly.

- The number of beats in 30 seconds is recorded, multiplied by 2, and the product recorded as the heart rate.

- Pulse may also be recorded from an arterial line.


16.4. Blood Pressure Measurements 

16.4.1. Overview of Blood Pressure Measurement In the KPMP Study, sitting and standing blood pressure is measured at a resting state, using three sitting measurements and one standing measurement. Blood pressure measurements will be recorded on the Physical Measurements CRF.
Blood pressure measurement steps outlined here can be followed satisfactorily for most participants in the outpatient setting. Exceptional situations occasionally arise with serious obstacles to successful blood pressure measurement.


16.4.2. Preparation for Blood Pressure Measurement Some of the many extraneous factors influencing blood pressure are controlled by standardizing the measurement technique and the environment in which the measurement is made. Uncontrolled factors (time of day, identity of the observer) are recorded, so that they can be considered during analysis.
Try to keep the blood pressure measurement as pleasant as possible. Participants should be given full explanation and instructions about the preparation for the blood pressure examination and an opportunity for brief questions. The setting in which blood pressure measurements are made will be standardized, and should take place in a separate, quiet room where no other activity is taking place, and where temperature fluctuations are minimal. Equipment should be checked when waiting for the participant. Arm measurement, cuff selection and placement should be completed prior to a five-minute rest period in this quiet room. The participant should be relaxed, seated with back supported with legs uncrossed and feet comfortably flat on the floor, not dangling.


16.4.3. Materials and Equipment 
- Automated or manual blood pressure device 
- Blood pressure cuffs in a variety of sizes 
- Measuring tape (for arm circumference).

- Watch or stopwatch (to time five-minute rest and resting heart rate).

- Copy of chart for choosing correct BP cuff size (see Table 10).


16.4.4. Preparation Before the BP measurement procedure, explain to the participant what to expect and how long the procedure will take. The following script is suggested:
This part of the exam involves taking your seated and standing blood pressure. It will take about 

10 minutes. We would like you to sit with both feet on the floor and your arm supported on the table. We will have you sit quietly for five minutes. Then we will take your seated blood pressure three times, one minute apart, using an automated device, followed by one standing blood pressure. We will give you your blood pressure readings and some material to help you interpret them at the end.


16.4.5. Arm Measurement and Cuff Size Use the proper cuff size to avoid under- or over-estimation of the correct blood pressure. Selection of the proper sized cuff is based on the guideline that the length of the inflatable bladder in the cuff should be at least 40% greater than the arm circumference. Measurement of the bladder length in the cuffs confirms that the chart in Table 10 conforms to this guideline. A copy of this chart should be available during the BP measurement procedure for easy reference. Selection of cuff size should be based on the chart in Table 10. If the participant’s arm size falls in a range in which there is overlap of two cuff sizes, use the larger cuff.
Measure the arm circumference as follows:

- Ask the participant to bare the upper arm that will be used to measure blood pressure.

- Ask the participant to sit or stand holding forearm horizontal, i.e., parallel to the floor.

- Measure arm length from the acromion (bony extremity of the shoulder girdle) to the olecranon (tip of the elbow) using a metric tape.

- Note the midpoint on the dorsal (back) surface of the arm.

- Ask participant to relax arm along the side of the body.

- Draw the measuring tape snugly around the arm at the midpoint mark, keeping the tape horizontal. Tape should not indent the skin. Record the arm circumference measured to the closest (0.1) cm in the Physical Measurements CRF.

- Use the criteria in Table 10, below, to determine cuff size, if necessary.
Table 10: Cuff Size Indicated by Measured Arm Circumference Arm Circumference* (cm) Cuff Name Bladder Length (cm) 

12-19 Child 8 

19.1-25 Small Adult 10 

25.1-33 Adult 13 

33.1-40 Large Adult 17 

40.1-50 Thigh 

16.4.6. Positioning the Participant 
- The workstation should be free of excessive noise or distractions.

- The participant should be seated and relaxed in a comfortable chair, to ensure that:

  - He or she is sitting up (not slouched).

  - Both feet are on the floor (legs/ankles not crossed).

  - Right forearm is supported resting on the table.

- The participant should not talk, eat, or drink during the procedure.

- Ideally, the machine output will not be visible to the participant during the measurement, as this may cause anxiety.


16.4.7. Application of the Blood Pressure Cuff Place the appropriate cuff around the arm so that the mid-height of the cuff is at heart level. Palpate the participant’s brachial artery and place cuff so that the artery is aligned with the cuff arrow marked “artery.”
Place the lower edge of the cuff, with its tubing connections, two centimeters above the natural crease across the inner aspect of the elbow.
Wrap the cuff snugly around the arm, with the palm of the participant's hand turned upward.
Secure the wrapped cuff firmly by applying pressure to the locking fabric fastener over the area where it is applied to the cuff.
Do not wrap the cuff too tightly around the arm. You should be able to insert the first joint of two fingers under the cuff. The cuff should be snug but not tight.
Be sure all air is squeezed out of the cuff before each inflation.


16.4.7.1. Sitting Pulse and Blood Pressure Measurement Separate each of three measurements by one minute.
Record the SBP, DBP and pulse in the Physical Measurements CRF Report the average of the last two blood pressures to the participant both verbally and in writing. The average of the two measurements will be calculated in the Physical Measurements CRF. This average is also used for reporting SBP and DBP alert values.


16.4.7.2. Standing Pulse and Blood Pressure Measurement After completing 3 seated blood pressure readings, raise the bedside table at the participant’s side so that unnecessary movement or walking will not occur when the participant is asked to stand. The participant is then asked to stand slowly with their arms relaxed at their sides for 2 minutes.

- After 2 minutes, place the participant’s arm on a pillow on the bedside table with the palm of the hand turned upward.

- The bedside table needs to be elevated so the arm can rest at heart level for the standing pulse and blood pressure.

- Take one standing blood pressure and pulse measurement as described above and record the values in the Physical Measurements CRF.


16.4.8. Reporting the Blood Pressure Results to the Participant The participant may wish to know his or her results before the results are entered into the database. If so, report the average the second and third readings that is calculated in the Physical Measurements CRF. State clearly the systolic and diastolic pressures and offer to write down these values for the participant.


16.5. Edema Assessment Edema is the swelling of tissues as a result of excess fluid accumulation. This swelling can occur in a single area, or across the whole body. For KPMP, we are looking for swelling in the legs (lower extremity edema), at the base of the spine (sacrum), or throughout the body (anasarca). This assessment is performed with a “pit” test. The edema assessment is not intended to record the presence of non-pitting edema.
Steps for performing a pit test:

- Press firmly on the areas listed in the Physical Measurements CRF with your fingers or thumb for 

5 seconds.

  - lower extremity (around the ankle) 
  - Sacrum (base of the spine) 
  - Anasarca (whole body swelling of the skin) 
- After 5 seconds stop pressing, remove your finger, and check for a persistent depression in the skin.

- If there is a depression, or “pit” present, the participant is positive for edema for the assessed area.

- Mark “present” or “absence” for edema for each area listed in the Physical Measurements CRF.
